As\nmissions are completed, their rewards are added to the pool and can be\npurchased using Eridium!\n\n# Legendary Gear available in Vending Machines\n\nWe have rebalanced vending machines based on community feedback. Vending\nmachines of all types have a small chance of providing Legendary gear for\npurchase. We\u2019ve also removed Uncommon (green) Rarity gear from the Item of the\nDay pool.\n\n# Chests and Badass reward adjustments\n\nThe quality of rewards found in chests and dropped from Badass enemies have\nbeen subtly buffed. Our goal is to make sure chests feel rewarding and\nexciting, and players feel properly rewarded for defeating difficult enemies.\n\n# Dedicated loot pool adjustments\n\nThe dedicated loot pools for bosses have been given a dramatic overhaul in\nhopes of making for a more reliable and satisfying farming experience. Most\nbosses have two pieces of gear assigned to them, though there are exceptions.\nTo reach this goal, we enabled respawning on the following bosses and\nreshuffled gear between bosses more evenly.\n\n  * Dumptruck\n  * Undertaker\n  * Mincemeat\n  * Buttmunch and Trufflemunch\n  * Sheega\n  * Rohner\n  * Rax\n  * Max\n  * Archer Rowe\n  * Bloodshine\n  * Muldock, the Anointed\n  * Artemis\n  * Apollo\n  * King Bobo\n  * King Gnasher\n  * Anointed X2\n  * Anointed X3\n  * Anointed X4\n  * Azalea\n  * Preston\n\n# Anointment pool adjustments\n\nTo further improve the farming experience, we examined the Anointment pool and\ndetermined some weren\u2019t engaging the community as we hoped. Given the depth of\nthe pool, we have removed the following 21 Anointments. Any gear that\ncurrently has these Anointments will continue to function properly, but gear\ndropped after this update will no longer roll with these Anointments.\n\n  * While Airborne, Critical Damage is increased 25%\n  * While Airborne, Damage is increased by 30%\n  * While Airborne, Fire Rate is increased 20%\n  * While Airborne, Accuracy and Handling are increased by 75%\n  * While Sliding, Damage is increased by 40%\n  * While Sliding, Accuracy and Handling are increased by 50%\n  * While Sliding, Fire Rate is increased by 25%\n  * While Sliding, building up energy that refills a portion of your shields.\n  * While an Action Skill is Active, reduce all incoming damage by a small amount\n  * While an Action Skill is Active, 250% of health damage taken is returned to the attacker as shock damage. \n  * On Action Skill End, Critical Damage is increased by 25% for a short time\n  * On Action Skill End, create a cyber spike that damages nearby enemies\n  * On Action Skill End, spawn a healing pool for several seconds\n  * On Action Skill End, Fire rate is increased by 11%, & reload speed by 26% for a short time\n  * On Action Skill End, Weapon Accuracy & Handling are greatly increased for a short time\n  * On Action Skill End, Movement speed is increased by 5% for a short time\n  * On Action Skill End, 30% of damage taken is returned to the attacker for a short time.\n  * After exiting Iron Bear, do not consume ammo for 5 seconds\n  * After using Phaseslam, damage taken is reduced by 20% and movespeed is increased by 12%\n  * After using Phasegrasp, Weapon Accuracy and Handling are greatly increased\n\n# A note on drop rates\n\nA few bosses have had some minor tweaks made to improve their looting\nexperience, but we have left most of the drop rates unchanged. With the\nthinning of the dedicated loot pools and the removal of 21 Anointments, we\ndecided to observe these changes first then make changes as needed in the\nfuture.\n\n# Stability\n\n  * Addressed a reported crash that could occur in splitscreen\n  * Reduced the number of projectiles that spawn due to damage dealt when using multiple elements on enemies and limited the number of times projectiles bounce to 4 \n\n_We have adjusted how projectiles from damage events spawn. We found spikes in\nstability and performance concerns when too many elemental projectiles were\nspawning during gameplay. This was due to some weapons spawning many more\nprojectiles than game performance recommended. The Recursion, Carrier,\nBearcat, Lead Sprinkler, and others will see the effects from this change. We\nwill be monitoring how players will be using these weapons for any possible\nadjustments in the future._\n\n# General\n\n  * Included additional supported languages for the [Bounty of Blood](https://borderlands.com/en-US/bountyofblood/) campaign add-on\n  * Addressed a reported concern that sometimes caused Trophies / Achievements to remain locked when all named locations were discovered\n  * Retroactively awarded Trophies / Achievements to players that met the requirements\n  * Addressed a reported concern where the Traitorweed projectile would only appear on the host player\n  * Addressed a reported concern where the Vladof \u201cCore Buster\u201d grenade mod could damage allies with child grenades spawned after the first explosion\n  * Addressed a reported concern where standing on the inactive jump pad as Scourge teleports the user will launch them out of the map and kill them on the second teleport in [Takedown at the Guardian Breach](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2020-06-11-takedown-at-the-guardian-breach/)\n  * Addressed a reported concern where Anathema the Relentless was not using the correct death damage data in Takedown at the Guardian Breach\n  * Addressed a reported concern where weapon trinkets would disappear from the collection after relaunching the game in the Bounty of Blood campaign add-on\n  * Addressed a reported concern where the Jetbeast mortar weapon was dealing damage twice\n\n# Mayhem Mode\n\n  * Addressed a reported concern where the splat attack from the Beastmaster\u2019s pet Scorcher was unintentionally receiving Mayhem damage scaling multiple times\n  * Increased Pet Damage Scaling in Mayhem\n\n _After making changes to the Scorcher\u2019s splat, we wanted to make sure it and\nother pets still felt fun and capable of competitive amounts of damage in\nMayhem, so we buffed pet damage accordingly._\n\n  * Addressed a bug where the Operative\u2019s Digi-clone was interacting with certain weapons like the O.P.Q. in a way that received Mayhem damage scaling multiple times\n  * Addressed a bug where the Gunner\u2019s Iron Bear and certain class mods like the Mind Sweeper could interact in a way that received Mayhem damage scaling multiple times\n\n _We identified a behavior in our damage pipeline that created opportunities\nfor certain gear and skill combinations to do excessive amounts of damage.

We are still\nmonitoring balance between Legendary gear but wanted to first address groups\nof weapons to increase opportunities for weapon builds.\n\nAll pistols will see a slight increase with JAKOBS pistols receiving the\nsmallest bump and MALIWAN pistols receiving the largest. As enemy health pools\nincreased, low mag size weapons like pistols became less popular. The damage\nincrease across all pistols should provide more opportunities for builds to\nequip a pistol to accommodate their other weapon choices.\n\nWe also increased damage of all TEDIORE SMG weapons because we believed the\ndamage from the thrown weapon explosion would be an integral part of the loop.\nHowever, throwing the weapon was impractical compared to shooting enemies with\nother SMGs. Now the trade-off to throwing at full magazine versus shooting\nwill be more dramatic.\n\nCOV, DAHL, and JAKOBS Assault Rifles were increased to match some of the\nVLADOF Assault Rifles. We will evaluate VLADOF Assault Rifles in totality\nafter players try the changes to the other manufacturers first.\n\nFinally, we increased the damage of our traditional multi-pellet shotguns.\nHYPERION, MALIWAN, and JAKOBS all received a damage increase. Some of these\nshotguns were underperforming compared to fast-firing weapons so now they will\npack a greater punch.\n\n  * Increased pistol damage across all manufacturers\n  * Increased damage on Tediore SMGs\n  * Increased damage on COV, Dahl, and Jakobs Assault Rifles\n  * Increased damage on Hyperion, Maliwan, and Jakobs shotguns\n\n# Bounty of Blood Hotfixes\n\nThese hotfixes are related specifically to the Bounty of Blood campaign add-\non.

To get the changes and avoid seeing any of these issues arise, make\nsure that you have your hotfixes applied at the main menu.\n\nTo apply hotfixes, wait at the main menu until you see a sign that says\n\u201cHotfixes Applied\u201d! If you are experiencing any issues or want to provide\nfeedback, please submit a ticket to support.2k.com.\n\n  * Added Revenge of the Cartel Anointments to the permanent drop pool for gear\n  * Addressed a reported concern that spikes from Mantakores and Korax ignored Zane\u2019s Barrier\n  * Re-balanced the number of enemies active at one time during Takedown at the Guardian Breach\n  * Re-balanced the health of some enemies during Takedown at the Guardian Breach\n  * Addressed a potential progression blocker when fast traveling during Takedown at the Guardian Breach\n  * Addressed a concern with the Operative\u2019s SNTNL not targeting enemies in some cases\n\n# Weapon Adjustments\n\nAs stated in the patch notes, we have adjusted the Health, Shield, and Armor\nstats for Mayhem Levels 7 and higher. As part of that change, we need to\nadjust gear to reflect that. With the decrease in enemy health, shield, and\narmor in later levels of Mayhem, all the gear you have currently will feel\nmore effective as you take down enemies in those higher levels. SMGs have\nproven to be one of the most popular weapon types, so we\u2019ve focused on them\nwith this update. We decided that this amount of change was all we were\ncomfortable with when paired with the scaling changes. We will observe player\nfeedback over the coming weeks and likely make further adjustments as needed.\n\n **Weapon Buffs**\n\n _The number of viable SMGs felt low, compared to the relative depth of\nweapons of that type. As a result, several them have had damage increases this\nweek._\n\n  * Increased weapons damage on Bitch\n  * Increased weapons damage on Handsome Jackhammer\n  * Increased weapons damage on Devoted\n  * Increased weapons damage on Cloud Kill\n  * Increased weapons damage on Tsunami\n  * Increased weapons damage on Ten Gallon\n  * Increased melee damage bonus on Ripper\n\n _The Ripper\u2019s melee damage bonus wasn\u2019t providing enough incentive to execute\nits intended loop. We\u2019ve buffed the damage on the melee strike._\n\n  * Increased weapon damage on Vanquisher\n\n _The base damage for the Vanquisher and its bonus damage while sliding have\nbeen buffed. Like the Ripper, its core loop wasn\u2019t being used as the slide\nbonus wasn\u2019t significant enough prior to this change._\n\n  * Increased bonus damage while sliding on Vanquisher\n\n _The Ripper and Vanquisher should be very effective now when embracing their\nunique loops._\n\n **Weapon Nerfs**\n\nWe found that a few pieces of gear were overperforming or not working as\nintended, which unintentionally pushed players into builds exclusively using\nthem. It also allowed players to bypass the intended growth of moving up the\nMayhem Levels over time. By lowering these values and addressing some data,\nplayers should feel able to experiment with other pieces of gear.\n\n **Sandhawk**\n\nThe Sandhawk was creating too many particle systems which we found creating\nissues related to performance. It also was creating too much damage relative\nto other sniper rifles. To combat this, we\u2019ve made the following changes.\n\n  * Increased Shot Cost from 2 to 3 \u2013 We\u2019ve increased the cost of firing the weapon, so that players have to more thoughtfully manage ammo. With the additional SDUs that were added in The Revenge of the Cartels patch, players should still be able to use this weapon quite a bit.\n  * Removed 2 projectiles \u2013 As stated, the performance cost of this weapon was too high, so we\u2019ve removed two particle systems from each shot. This also removes some damage output from the weapon.\n  * Increased Accuracy Spread \u2013 To make up for the difference for the missing projectiles, we\u2019ve spread out the pattern, so it still covers the same space.\n  * Lowered lifetime of projectiles \u2013 Too many active particle systems from consecutive shots was really hurting performance, so we\u2019ve lowered the lifespan of the projectile.\n  * Increased projectile speed \u2013 It was important to use to keep the weapon still effective in combat, so to counter the lowered lifetime of the projectiles, we\u2019ve sped them up. The result is a weapon that still feels as effective as before, and even more responsive.\n\n **Yellowcake**\n\nWe discovered an unfortunate issue with the Yellowcake that effectively added\nan extra 100% damage beyond its intended output. We are fixing it today.\n\n  * Changed Damage Scaling \u2013 The wrong scaling math was applying to the Yellowcake, greatly increasing its damage beyond its intended value. We are changing it to use intended math.\n  * Split Projectile Damage Decrease \u2013 We are lowering the damage of each of its split projectiles as they were overperforming as well.\n\n **Kaoson**\n\nThe Kaoson was providing more power than intended, which made it the go-to\nSMG. With today\u2019s changes it should still provide plenty of damage that\nfocuses on explosive damage bonuses, but not quite at the scale as in the\npast.\n\n  * Accuracy Impulse Increased \u2013 Its accuracy allowed players to deal pin-point damage, then with the added explosive damage, it was further maximizing output. We are increasing the accuracy impulse to account for the explosive damage bonus better.\n  * Max Accuracy Increased \u2013 At full auto, the spread proved exceedingly tight, again allowing more damage to be maximized than we intended. We\u2019ve increased the maximum accordingly.\n  * Critical Damage Reduced \u2013 The explosive damage provided by this weapon allows critical hits more frequently, so we are lowering its critical bonus by a small amount.\n  * Base Damage Decreased \u2013 As the Kaoson basically has two points of damage\u2014the initial bullet, and then the explosive round\u2014it was providing way more damage than a typical SMG. We\u2019re lowering the base damage to better account for its dual damage feature.\n\n **Anointment Buffs**\n\nSeveral Anointments in the game were not providing enough value, effectively\nmaking them non-viable for players. In an effort to increase build diversity,\nwe are buffing a number of Anointments.\n\n  * Airborne Anointments \u2013 We\u2019ve increased the effectiveness of the While Airborne Damage, Critical Damage, and Fire Rate Anointment. The Airborne Fire Rate Anointment had a bug as well, which is being fixed to substantially improve this Anointment. We\u2019re anxious to see what builds will be used in Takedown at the Guardian Breach in particular.\n  * Slide Fire Rate \u2013 It had a bug as well that prevented it from providing the intended bonus; we\u2019ve resolved that in these hotfixes.\n  * Action Skill End \u2013 A number of these types of Anointments have been buffed to make them more useful for more builds. Fire Rate, Next 2 Mag Bonus Damage, and Splash Damage have all received damage increases.\n  * Auto Bear Active Incendiary Damage \u2013 This has received a significant buff to make Iron Bear builds more effective.\n\n", "2020-05-28-borderlands-3-hotfixes-may-28": "Today we will release a hotfix for [Borderlands 3](https://borderlands.com/en-US/shop/borderlands-3-super-deluxe-edition), which will be live on all\nplatforms by 12:00 PM PST.

To help him understand the emotional rollercoaster that is Broken\nHearts Day, you\u2019ll need to blast the floating hearts that are popping up over\nbaddies\u2019 heads all over the galaxy. Maurice will reward you with sweet Broken\nHearts Day loot for your trouble, **including two level 53 weapons:**\n**Terminal Polyaimorous and Wedding Invitation**!\n\n#### Event Toggle\n\nFor the Vault Hunter who already has everything, or prefers their gameplay to\nbe more straightforward, you can now disable the Broken Hearts Day Event in\nthe main menu.

Simply press any key during the scene and you\u2019ll be\nprompted to confirm the skip.\n\n### Level Cap increased to 53\n\nThe level cap has been increased to 53, providing everyone with 3 more skill\npoints to aim for!

Future Takedowns will\nalso launch with both modes enabled.\n\nThe default setting keeps the Takedown scaled depending on how many people are\nin your party. To turn back on 4-player scaling, toggle the new switch to the\nright of the Takedown door.\n\n### Guardian Ranks\n\nYou are now able to turn off individual Guardian Ranks or the whole system! If\nthere are any perks that aren\u2019t playing nice with your builds, you can now\ndisable them! Furthermore, for those who want to enjoy a vanilla leveling\nexperience, you have the ability to disable the entire system. This includes\nboth stat bonuses and all perks.\n\n **When the patch goes live, the Guardian Rank system will be turned off by\ndefault,** giving you a great opportunity to look through your perks to see if\nthere\u2019s anything new you want to try! _Note: while the Guardian Rank system is\nturned off, you will not be able to gain ranks._\n\n## Stadia\n\nWith this patch, Stadia is now caught up to the other platforms!

For the next two weeks, every boss in the game has boosted drop\nrates, including the Takedown at the Maliwan Blacksite bosses!\n\nMay these two weeks be challenging, rewarding, and full of loot!\n\n _*The Debt Collector is excluded from this list, as it\u2019s tied to an\nachievement!_\n\n# Bug Fixes\n\n  * Addressed a reported concern with itemcard and hotfix sometimes not showing information correctly\n  * Addressed a reported concern that Judge Hightower was sometimes not dropping items from his dedicated item pool\n  * Adjusted the balance of Fabrikator, Freddie, ST4NL3Y, Constructor, Tony Bordel, Tricksy Nick, and Third Rail to provide a greater challenge\n\n _Developer note \u2013 We noticed that the bosses in the Handsome Jackpot weren\u2019t\nproviding players with a satisfying challenge. We\u2019ll be monitoring these\nbosses and make adjustments as needed in the future._\n\n  * The Ion Cannon now has a 5 second reload and consumes at least 6 ammo per shot\n\n _The Ion Cannon is a strong weapon and we don\u2019t want to change that, but it\u2019s\na little over performing._ _We\u2019ve increased the reload time and made it\nconsume more ammo but left its damage unchanged to still provide a strong\nburst of damage._\n\n  * Added collisions to prevent the Gunner from sometimes becoming stuck in Meridian Mercantile\n  * Added collisions to prevent players from sometimes escaping the map in various locations\n  * Increased the radius of the New-U station at The Arrogant Approach\n  * Addressed a reported perceived progression blocker when using Glamour on The Abomination during \u201cIt\u2019s Alive\u201d\n\n# Increased Anointment Effectiveness for the Operative, Gunner, and\nBeastmaster\n\nIn looking at the bonuses from Anointments, we felt that some were not\nproviding enough of a bonus. We\u2019ve increased the bonuses on the Anointments\nbelow.\n\n **Moze the Gunner**\n\n  * While Auto Bear is active, deals 75% (from 20%) bonus incendiary damage\n  * After exiting Iron Bear, the next 2 magazines will have 125% (from 40%) bonus incendiary damage\n  * After exiting Iron Bear, gain 160% (from 120%) increased Splash damage for 18 seconds\n  * When entering and exiting Iron Bear, nova damage increased\n\n **Zane the Operative**\n\n  * While Barrier is active, Accuracy is increased by 60%, and Critical Hit damage is increased by 70% (from 30%)\n  * While SNTL is active, gain 100% (from 50%) of damage as bonus Cryo damage\n\n **FL4K the Beastmaster**\n\n  * When exiting Fade Away, nova damage increased\n  * After using Rakk Attack!, gain 50% (from 25%) critical hit damage for a short time\n\n", "2020-01-09-borderlands-3-hotfixes-jan-9": "Today we will release a hotfix for [Borderlands 3](https://borderlands.com/en-US/shop/borderlands-3-super-deluxe-edition), which will be live on\nPlayStation\u00ae4, Xbox One, and PC by 3:00 PM PST.

Below are the notes for\nboth today's patch and hotfix.\n\n#  **Notes for Patch 4**\n\n# New Content:\n\n **Takedown at the Maliwan Blacksite**\n\n  * Lorelei has recruited the Vault Hunters to destroy a top-secret weapon Maliwan has been developing at their Blacksite. You and your squad should prepare for an extreme challenge because this content is balanced for four players at level 50. You can gain access to the Blacksite via a mission found on [Sanctuary III](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2019-09-04-borderlands-3-sanctuary-iii/) after completing the main campaign with that character.\n  * Takedowns feature special rules not found in the rest of the game! Respawning is disabled, so make sure you and your co-op partners get Second Wind or you'll spectate until the team wipes. If you do die, you're not out permanently! Die during the first half, you'll get to rejoin your team if they defeat the Valkyrie Squad. If you're out the second half, but your team manages to defeat Wotan The Invincible, you'll get to respawn to enjoy the rewards you didn't completely earn!\n  * Make sure your squad is in the session before you throw the switch inside the Air Lock, or anyone who joins after the switch is thrown joins as a spectator!\n\n **Mayhem 4**\n\n  * Mayhem 4 is here for players looking for the toughest challenge in the game! Mayhem 4 adds another increase to enemy health, increases the loot drop chances, and adds a set of new Legendaries! Because the health value greatly increased, Mayhem 4 also slightly adjusts the random modifier system. Mayhem 4 will only roll one positive modifier for the player and one enemy bonus modifier. We want players to try different builds without severely hampering their ability to take down enemies in Mayhem 4. _Note that Mayhem 1-3 are unchanged._\n  * In addition to increasing enemy health and adjusting the modifiers, Mayhem 4 contains new Legendary weapons and class mods for players to hunt. These new pieces of gear will contribute to new builds and new ways to kill enemies!\n  * To support Mayhem 4, we changed the Mayhem station slightly. Players will activate Mayhem through the center pillar and increase or decrease Mayhem levels by using the pillars on each side. Looking forward, we will monitor the challenge of Mayhem 4 closely. We're working hard on Mayhem 2.0, which will add brand new gameplay additions to Mayhem Mode in the future. Until then, we hope you enjoy the challenge and new loot!\n\n **Bank Expansion**\n\nAll characters now begin the game with 20 bank slots instead of 10. The\nexisting Bank SDUs will give everyone a total of 100 available spaces. An\nadditional 10 Bank SDUs are available to purchase in Marcus's shop on\nSanctuary III using the in-game cash currency, each awarding 20 spaces, for a\ngrand total of 300 total bank spaces!\n\n **Dedicated Loot Pools for Bosses**\n\nAll bosses have been updated with new loot pools that give them dedicated\nLegendary items to drop. Players can now discover which bosses drop their\nfavorite gear and more easily farm their favorite items. Let the hunt begin!\n\n **Additional Vending Machines**\n\nThe following environments have received additional vending machines. They can\ntypically be found before bosses or the mid waypoint in larger environments:\n\n  * Athenas\n  * Atlas HQ\n  * Lectra City\n  * Jakobs Estate\n  * Voracious Canopy\n  * Tazendeer Ruins\n  * The Pyre of Stars\n\n **Target Dummy**\n\nPlayers can take out their aggression, or test their gear, on a Handsome Jack\ntarget inside the shooting range on Sanctuary III.\n\n# End Game Character Balance\n\nFor this patch, we adjusted many passives involving companions such as Iron\nBear, Digi-Clone, and FL4K pets in general. We wanted to increase their\nviability for later levels of Mayhem while also targeting some passives that\nwere underperforming compared to some others. Iron Bear saw increases to the\nbase scaling and additional bonuses were added through passives and augments.\nWe allowed some of Zane's kill-skill bonuses to stack up to two times,\nincreasing their output under certain conditions. FL4K pets also saw some\nincreases over level to their damage so that they didn't feel underpowered for\nMayhem Mode. We are currently happy with the variety of Amara's builds, but we\nare always monitoring feedback and will adjust if necessary.\n\n **Moze**\n\n  * Iron Bear Damage increased per level, to a total of just under 150% at max level\n  * Desperate Measures now gives Iron Bear the bonus too\n  * Experimental Munitions - Iron Bear also deals bonus fire damage on critical hits\n  * Scorching RPM's also

them\n  * Increased Iron Bear Bubble Shield from 20% to 50% of Moze's health\n\n **Zane**\n\n  *  _SNTL_ damage scale increased by 2% per level\n  *  _Donnybrook, Pocket Full of Grenades, Cool Hand, Violent Violence,_ and _Violent Speed_ bonuses now stack twice\n  * Fixed _Violent Momentum_ to scale more at higher movement speeds\n  *  _Best Served Cold_ radius and damage increased by 2% per level\n  *  _Confident Confidence_ increased max weapon damage bonus from 20% to 35%\n  * Changed _Trick of the Light_ element to Cryo and increased bonus from 18% to 36%\n  *  _Borrowed Time_

Full of Grenades_ bonus slightly decreased from 6.5% to 5% as it now stacks\n  *  _Violent Violence_ bonus slightly decreased from 4% to 3% as it now stacks\n\n **FL4K**\n\n  *  _Ambush Predator_ now has a HUD Icon when the buff is active\n  * Increased the pet damage to scale 10/5% per level instead of 9%\n  * Added pet damage to _Grim Harvest_ at 7% per level\n  * Added pet damage to _The Most Dangerous Game_ at 9% per level\n  * Added pet damage to _Interplanetary Stalker_ at 1% per stack, per level\n  * Added pet damage to _Furious Attack_ at 0.6% per stack\n  * Added pet damage to _The Fast and the Furryous_ at 10% per level\n  *  _Lick the Wounds_ gained a pet damage buff after reviving the player\n  * Increased pet damage for _Psycho Head on a Stick_ from 10% to 20%\n  * Increased damage in _Pack Tactics_ from 5% to 7% per level\n  * Adjusted _Megavore_ to not reward critical hit bonuses when receiving damage from self-damage\n\n# Stability\n\n  * Fixed multiple crashes that

when\nBorderlands 3 is connected to the internet. Unlike updates, hotfixes are not\npermanent\u2014they are temporarily stored in memory during the game session and\nlost upon exiting Borderlands 3.

But given that we're just about a month out\nfrom Borderlands 3's launch, we'd like to take this opportunity to outline our\nplans for future updates, including some of the community's most frequently\nrequested changes. There can always be unforeseen challenges when working on\npatches and hotfixes, so we'll keep you posted on more concrete release\ntimings as these updates continue to progress. Here's a look at some of the\nthings we're working to implement in future patches.\n\n# Performance and Stability\n\nGame performance and stability continue to be our top priorities. The first\nfruits of that labor will be released in our upcoming November patch, with\nvarious improvements game-wide. We've also been hard at work improving the\ngame's stability and more improvements in this regard are expected to be\nincluded in the November patch. Performance and stability will continue to be\nan ongoing effort with more fixes rolled out with each upcoming patch.\n\n# The Bank\n\nExpanding the bank has been the most consistently requested feature by the\ncommunity. We've heard you loud and clear and the groundwork for expanding the\nbank has already started. The first of several planned expansions will\ncoincide with the release of Takedown at Maliwan's Blacksite. Expect a\nsignificant bank expansion that will more than double the existing space.\nAdditional expansions to the bank will continue to be rolled out over future\nreleases.\n\n# Dedicated Loot Pools for Bosses\n\nSeveral of you have stated a desire to find gear more easily in the game. To\ndo that we are updating the loot pools (the data that determines what in-game\nitems drop) to ensure that more specific gear drops from bosses. That means\nyou'll be able to go to a specific boss to get the specific gear you're\nlooking for. We're working out which bosses get which gear right now and\nexpect this to be ready as part of the November patch as well.\n\n# Character Buffs\n\nIn the late stages of the game when Mayhem Mode is active, we've found that\nplayer companions (Moze's Iron Bear, FL4K's pets, and Zane's Digi-Clone/SNTL)\nare reportedly not performing as well as we had expected. To address this,\nwe're looking at how to adjust damage according to the relevant skills and\ngear. The goal here is to make sure we have as many viable character builds as\npossible.\n\n# Additional Mayhem Levels and Mayhem 2.0\n\nMayhem Mode has been a fantastic addition to the Borderlands world. After\nreceiving some great community feedback, we've been hard at work on a\nsignificant revamp that will introduce a host of improvements over several\nupcoming updates.\n\nThe first update will be released as part of the Takedown at Maliwan's\nBlacksite and includes the first new Mayhem Mode level, Mayhem 4. Expect a\nsignificant challenge when it debuts, with tougher enemies that reward players\nwith highly synergized character builds. A new batch of Legendary gear will\nalso only drop while in Mayhem 4 to reward those players who are truly up for\nthe challenge.\n\nLonger term we have plans to overhaul Mayhem Mode with more UI support, new\nMayhem Modifiers that change gameplay more dramatically, Mayhem playlists, new\nrewards, and additional levels of Mayhem to work through. We're excited about\nMayhem 2.0 and we'll talk more about it when we get a little closer to its\nrelease.\n\n# Vending Machines\n\nMarcus heard the outcry for more vending machines, so we're airdropping in\nsome more across multiple maps. Expect new ammo and health vending machines\noutside of a few boss arenas and a few in some of the bigger environments.\nBelow are the locations where the new vending machines will be appearing:\n\n  * Athenas\n  * Atlas HQ\n  * Skywell-27\n  * Lectra City\n  * Jakobs Estate\n  * Voracious Canopy\n  * Tazendeer Ruins\n  * The Pyre of Stars\n\n# Skippable Cinematics\n\nWe're currently investigating the best way to approach letting players skip\ncutscenes. This is much easier said than done. Under the hood, the game may\nactivate critical events based on cinematics. In order to make sure mission\nprogression isn't negatively impacted, we need to inspect each cinematic and\nmake sure those events still work correctly. We have a few ideas on how to\ntackle this problem and expect to have a solution soon.\n\n# Target Dummy\n\nNeed an easier way to test your gear? We're going to add a target dummy to the\nshooting range on Sanctuary III! We feel this is the best location since your\nbank is also on the ship. This way you can manage and test your builds on\nSanctuary III without having to travel anywhere else. You can expect to see\nthis sometime in December.\n\n# The Future\n\nThe list above is only a high-level look at what some of our teams are working\non. Stay tuned as we continue to add more information and additions to this\nlist. We here at Gearbox are excited about where Borderlands 3 is heading, and\nwe look forward to showing you all the content that's still to come!\n\n", "2019-10-17-borderlands-3-hotfixes-oct-17": "This week\u2019s [Borderlands 3](https://borderlands.com/en-US/shop/borderlands-3-super-deluxe-edition) hotfixes, which will be live on\nall platforms by or before 3:00 PM PDT today, adjust Legendary gear across all\nmanufacturers. Our goal with Legendary gear is to enable a large variety of\nplaystyles and builds for all characters. After looking through the data, we\nfound that that some pieces of Legendary gear were greatly outperforming\nothers and felt they were limiting builds instead of increasing them. In\naddition, some of the damage output of Legendary gear limited the growth in\ncombat engagements for the future so we tuned everything to an acceptable\nmedian. We expect all Vault Hunters to be able to create amazing builds and we\nwant to support that with more ways to grow and reach those power levels.\n\n# Weapon Hotfixes\n\n **Maliwan**\n\n  * Westergun damage increased by 25%\n  * ASMD damage increased by 28%\n  * Cutsman damage reduced by 25%\n\n **Tediore**\n\n  * Ten Gallon damage increased by 8%\n\n **Vladof**\n\n  * Sickle reload speed increased by 25%\n  * Faisor damage increased by 15%\n  * Infiniti damage increased by 40%\n  * Magnificent damage increased by 25%\n  * Jericho damage increased by 40%\n  * Lucian\u2019s Call accuracy and handling reduced\n  * Lyuda Critical Damage Bonus decreased by 30% and made a modification to address a reported bug that an extra bullet was spawned in the center\n\n _The Lyuda\u2019s functionality is to split the projectile from 1 to 3 after a\ncertain distance. It was reported that the original projectile was never\ndestroyed in the process of splitting so 1 projectile actually became 4.\nAddressing this concern effectively removed a full shot\u2019s worth of damage\nwhich auto-corrects the base damage of the weapon. Since we increased all\nsniper rifle critical damage bonus in a previous hotfix, we reduced some of\nthe critical damage bonus on the Lyuda._\n\n **Torgue**\n\n  * Try-Bolt damage increased by 25%\n  * Alchemist damage increased by 25%\n  * Devils Foursum damage increased by 13%\n  * Flakker now consumes the full magazine when fired and damage is reduced by 33%\n\n _Flakker was greatly outperforming other shotguns due to the number of\nprojectiles and the high rate of fire. We initially believed the resulting\nprojectile spread would cause most of the explosions to miss the target,\nhowever this turned out to be false, so we reduced the projectile damage and\nallowed the weapon to only fire once per magazine. This change encourages\nplayers to capitalize on different stat bonuses to maximize the weapon\u2019s\ndamage output._\n\n  * Laser-Sploder rocket projectiles spawn interval increased by 0.4 seconds\n\n **Jakobs**\n\n  * Maggie damage increased by 35%\n  * Hellwalker damage reduced by 8%\n\n **Hyperion**\n\n _We found that a couple of the Legendary Hyperion weaponry bypassed the\nHyperion manufacturer playstyle too easily making their bonuses greatly\noutweigh the penalties. The Butcher was drastically outperforming all metrics\nand we chose to reduce the damage in order to keep the fast fire rate._\n\n  * Conference Call damage increased by 15%\n  * Crossroad accuracy reduced and it now fires 3 projectiles instead of 4\n  * Butcher accuracy reduced and damage reduced by 25%\n\n **DAHL**\n\n  * Vanquisher damage increased by 20%\n\n **Children of the Vault**\n\n  * Skeksis damage increased by 15%\n  * Linoge damage increased by 20%\n  * Pain is Power damage increased by 25%\n\n **Atlas**\n\n  * Ruby\u2019s Wrath damage increased by 10%\n\n **Grenades**\n\n _Hex and Firestorm were calibrated to the wrong grenade modifier. These two\ngrenades were envisioned to specialize by applying elemental DoTs to targets.\nInstead they were resulting in large amounts of damage and the elemental DoTs\nwere minimal. We realize this is a drastic change on both of these grenades,\nbut we did not want to remove the spectacle of the grenade (number of grenades\nspawned, number of targets hit, etc.) and focused on allowing their core\nidentity to be emphasized instead of them continuing to just be high damage\ngrenades._\n\n  * Hunter-Seeker damage increased by 25%\n  * Hex grenade damage reduced by 70% and duration reduced to 3 seconds\n  * Firestorm damage reduced by 70%\n\n **Artifacts**\n\n _It was reported that the Legendary artifact, Elemental Projector, had a bug\nresulting in the max value being displayed at 183% instead of the actual max\nvalue of 113%. Therefore, we addressed the discrepancy and reduced the max\nvalue to 90%._\n\n  * Elemental Projector damage max roll reduced to 90%\n\n# Vault Hunter Adjustments\n\n _The current state of Moze\u2019s Iron Bear, Zane\u2019s Digi-Clone, and FL4K\u2019s pets\nhave made players focus on other elements besides those Vault Hunter\u2019s\nfundamental action skills in the late game. While longer term solutions to\nscaling their damage is explored, we have boosted the health of Iron Bear, the\nDigi-Clone, and the pets to make them more viable. We will have more to say\nabout long term solutions for these characters in the future._\n\n  *  _Iron Bear:_ health increased by 50%\n  * All pets\u2019 health increased by 50%\n  *  _Digi-Clone:_ health increased by 100%\n  * Addressed a bug with _Salvation_ where grenades were giving life-steal\n\n# Bug Fixes\n\n  * Psychos will now use their True Vault Hunter Mode name in True Vault Hunter Mode\n  * Removed the optional Rare Spawn missions from Galaxy Progress\n  * Addressed a reported bug where Completely Sane Sid didn\u2019t always become hostile when using FL4K\n  * Addressed a reported bug where Ratch would not properly spawn during \u201cRatch\u2019d Up\u201d, which potentially blocked completion of that side mission\n  * Included a modification so Lilith would continue to move toward the door in Shiv\u2019s confession chamber during \u201cFrom the Ground Up\u201d\n  * Lowered the chance for a weapon to drop from the Pachinko machine\n  * Included a modification so that Zane\u2019s Digi-Clone will no longer spawn into the cage in Cistern of Slaughter\n  * Shield Boosters were modified and are now set for autopickup\n  * An addition was introduced so Eridium chests are no longer listed as Red Chests in the ECHOcast extension on Sanctuary III\n\n", "2019-10-10-borderlands-3-hotfixes-oct-10": "This week's [Borderlands 3](https://borderlands.com/en-US/shop/borderlands-3-super-deluxe-edition) hotfixes, which will be live on\nall platforms by or before 3:00 PM PDT today, address some player character\npassive abilities, gear balance, and some quality-of-life issues across the\ngame. We're watching the character builds that players are creating and are\nlooking through all the different gear available to make sure that there is\nsomething for everyone. This week, and in the coming weeks, there will be\nfurther adjustments to gear with the hopes of creating even more build types.\nOur goal is to adjust some of the less-used Legendary gear to bring them to\nthe same level as some of the more popular options.\n\nIn addition, we are addressing reported bugs and are hard at work continuing\nto address other performance concerns. Thank you so much for your feedback and\nsupport. Please continue to submit any bugs you run into at\n[support.2k.com](https://support.2k.com/).\n\n# Vault Hunter Adjustments\n\n**Amara**\n\n _We addressed a concern that_ Alacrity _was only rewarding players one point\nworth of bonuses even if the player put in more than one point. In addition,\nwe wanted_ Phasegrasp _to be more accessible to all weapon types and play\nstyles, so we doubled the range to grasp an enemy._\n\n  * Putting points into _Alacrity_ now awards a reload speed bonus per rank\n  *  _Phasegrasp_ can now be used on targets further away and the cooldown is now instantly returned if a player misses\n\n **Moze**\n\n _The_ Bloodletter _class mod was creating some overwhelming synergies for\nMoze so we increased the delay and decreased the recharge rate of the shield\nto compensate. This should help encourage the intended use of this class mod,\nwhich is to heal shields manually, not automatically._ Means of Destruction\n_\u2019s re-trigger delay was adjusted again because the change limited other\nbuilds beyond creating infinite grenades. The infinite grenade bug will be\naddressed in a future patch but we wanted to enable other builds that use_\nMeans of Destruction _so we dramatically reduced the re-trigger delay to a\nreasonable number._\n\n  *  _Bloodletter_ Class Mod  \n\\- Increased the Recharge Delay by 150%  \n\\- Reduced the Recharge Rate by 50%\n\n  * Addressed a reported bug with _Close the Distance_ so the Action Skill Augment will now deal the intended Shock Damage\n  *  _Means of Destruction_ now has a re-trigger delay of 0.3 seconds\n\n **FL4K**\n\n _The_ Leave No Trace _change last week to FL4K was to forcefully inject the\nfunctionality of a cooldown into the ability. However, the value that was\nadded was never the intended the value. We dramatically lowered it to retain\nthe promise of the ability but with a cooldown that still allows players to\ngain ammo without dramatically removing a core aspect of a weapon\u2019s gameplay\nloop._\n\n  *  _Leave No Trace_ now has a re-trigger delay set to 0.3 seconds\n\n **Zane**\n\n  *  _Death Follows Close_ will correctly update several Kill Skills after unlocking this ability\n\n# Weapon Hotfixes\n\n  * The Lob's projectile tick damage is now 60% of base damage (up from 20%) and projectile speed decelerates faster to increase chances of hitting the same target multiple times\n  * Creeping Death damage increased by 200%\n  * Carrier damage increased by 60%\n  * Gunerang damage increased by 20%\n  * All Sniper Rifle Zoom Levels have been slightly reduced\n  * Long scopes on Jakobs, Children of the Vault, and DAHL Assault Rifles have also been slightly reduced\n  * Anointed Parts:  \n\\- When Zane swaps positions with his Digi-Clone, the damage gained is\nincreased to 130% (up from 75%)  \n\\- When FL4K hits a target with Rakks, the target now takes 100% increased\ndamage (up from 50%)  \n\\- The Anointed part \"Increased damage vs Badasses\" no longer heals the player\nand now correctly adds bonus damage to Badass enemies\n\n# Bug Fixes\n\n  * Pain, Terror, and Agonizer 9000 have been adjusted to have an increased chance to drop higher quality loot\n  * Addressed a reported bug with Dynasty Diner that could potentially halt mission progress for some players\n  * Addressed a reported concern that some players fell through the floors in various boss arenas\n  * Modified enemy spawn level discrepancies reported in the later parts of the campaign\n\n _We noticed that some enemies were spawning at lower levels than expected in\nthe later parts of the campaign.

To\nencourage more build diversity, we made some adjustments to FL4K and Moze this\nweek.\n\nWe also looked at a few boss fights and made balance changes to make their\ncombats more enjoyable. Finally, we went over some enemy behaviors that could\nhave affected mission progression and adjusted some attacks to happen with\nmore frequency.\n\n# Vault Hunter Adjustments\n\n **FL4K**\n\n _Rakk Attack!_ is great for constant damage output, especially when paired\nwith Anointed gear. The base skill still seems to be lacking, so _Rakk\nAttack!_ now has a guaranteed status effect on any enemy that it damages.\n_Leave No Trace_ was returning much more ammo than intended, and we have added\na re-trigger delay to keep its ammo return within expectation. _Barbaric Yawp_\nhas an increased bonus, as we didn\u2019t feel that the amount of investment had an\nequal payoff. In addition, we felt that FL4K\u2019s pets were demanding too much\nattention, which was interfering with players trying to stand still for any\nlength of time, so we disabled the ability for them to move you around.\n\n  *  _Rakk Attack!_ status effect chance as been increased to 100%.\n  *  _Leave No Trace_ now has a re-trigger delay of 2 seconds\n  *  _Barbaric Yawp_ stat bonus increased by 100%\n  * Pets no longer push around player characters\n  * \u201cTouch Pet\u201d prompt is now a lower priority and should no longer interfere with looting or vending machines\n\n **Moze**\n\nInfinite Grenades is not an intentional build for Moze\u2014even if it is\nhilarious. To lower the power (and spam) of this build, a re-trigger delay has\nbeen added to the grenade portion of _Means of Destruction_.\n\n  *  _Means of Destruction_ now has a re-trigger delay of 2 seconds\n\n# Miscellaneous Changes\n\n  * Adjusted the balance of Gigamind, Katagawa Ball, and Billy the Anointed\n\n _These three boss fights had concerns with their health and shields that made\ntheir combat loops more difficult than we intended. Gigamind had a little too\nmuch health, so that was reduced slightly. Katagawa Ball will no longer\nregenerate its shields; we found that while players contended with the adds\nduring the fight, it would unfairly regenerate its shield, negating the\nplayers\u2019 progress. Finally, Billy had 25% of his health removed; we agree that\nthis fight often dragged on needlessly. We will be monitoring each of these\nbosses and may make further adjustments in the future._\n\n  * Bloated Rakks no longer spawn so many Rakklesnakes\n\n _This change should make the Cistern of Slaughter in particular much more\nfun._\n\n  * Adjusted the cooldown values when they are displayed for Zane\u2019s skills\n  * Amara\u2019s _Glamour_ will now turn enemies on each other, as described in the Action Skill\n  * Modified the loot spawn for Sera of Supremacy\n  * Spiderant Emperors occasionally wouldn\u2019t drill back out of the ground, which created a potential progression blocker in the Proving Ground of Survival; we have adjusted this and the issue has been addressed\n  * Resolved an issue that could have prevented enemies from spawning while in Devil\u2019s Razor\n  * Lavender Crawly\u2019s physics were adjusted to prevent them exiting the world like a popped balloon\n  * Further safe guarded Apollo from being launched out of world as well\n  * The Rampager will no longer enter an idle at state at inappropriate times\n  * Saurian Slingers attacks were addressed\n  * Guardians now use all their attacks in Playthrough 2\n  * Guardian Wraiths now reliably use all their ranged attacks\n  * NPCs in the Slaughter maps were reported to sometimes attempt to automatically revive players in the arena. Going forward they will no longer attempt to revive players\n  * Minimized the glow effect when opening Eridian ammo chests, can more easily see the ammo inside when opened\n\n", "2019-09-27-borderlands-3-hot-fixes-sept-27": "This week\u2019s [Borderlands 3](https://borderlands.com/en-US/shop/borderlands-3-super-deluxe-edition) hotfixes, which will be live by or\nbefore 3:00 PM PDT today, target weapon & enemy balance, player characters,\nand adjusting chances of specific unique drops. Billions of guns were fired\nand after collecting some data, we wanted to balance some weapon types and\nweapon manufacturers. These adjustments are intended to even the playing field\nand increase build diversity for all Vault Hunters. Speaking of build\ndiversity, Zane has received a gadget upgrade and we\u2019re excited to see players\ncreate more unique builds with him! Many Crew Challenge enemies have specific\nloot drops but we received reports that some were not dropping them. We have\nmade some modifications so they now have an increased chance of dropping their\nunique gear in addition to any other gear that may drop!\n\n# Weapon Hotfixes\n\n _Sniper Rifles_\n\n _Sniper rifles deal high damage but felt a little cumbersome to use in\ncertain scenarios. This change will increase their overall damage and increase\nusability in more combat engagements._\n\n  * Critical Damage increased by 20%\n  * Fire Rate increased by 15%\n  * Time to Aim Down Sights (ADS) reduced by 15%\n  * Time to Equip reduced by 20%\n\n _Pistols_\n\n _Jakobs and Torgue Pistols were outperforming other manufacturers, dealing\ndamage to groups of enemies at a much higher rate than other pistols. This\nchange keeps their identity intact but reduces overall group control. TEDIORE,\nDAHL, and Children of the Vault Pistols have manufacturer penalties that\naffected their overall damage. Increasing their overall damage will overcome\nsome of the penalties while retaining their unique gameplay style and feel._\n\n  * Increased damage on all TEDIORE Pistols by 15%\n  * Increased damage on all DAHL Pistols by 15%\n  * Increased damage on all Children of the Vault Pistols by 20%\n  * Reduced damage on Jakobs Pistols by 15%\n  * Reduced damage on Torgue Pistols by 10%\n\n _Maliwan Manufacturer_\n\n _Maliwan weapons had reduced overall damage because they applied elemental\nDoTs at a rate and damage greatly above other manufacturers. This effect was\ntoned down before launch, but the overall damage was not sufficiently adjusted\nto compensate for the reduction in elemental DoTs. We\u2019re adding back some of\nthe overall damage and making the weapons faster so elemental builds can\nreally take advantage of Maliwan weaponry._\n\n  * All Maliwan Weapon Damage increased by 25%\n  * All Maliwan Weapon Fire Rate increased by 20%\n\n _Atlas Manufacturer_\n\n _Atlas weapons relied on a game loop that we felt gave players a greater\nadvantage when used correctly. Turns out the loop is not used if the damage\ndoesn\u2019t compensate for the time to set up. So now damage on Atlas weapons\nshould facilitate players using them in general on top of feeling badass when\nthey take advantage of Atlas technology._\n\n  * All Atlas Weapon Damage increased by 25%\n\n _Miscellaneous Adjustments_\n\n _The Jakobs Assault Rifle change was to differentiate the Assault Rifle from\nthe pistol as more of a mid to long range powerhouse. Since the Assault Rifles\nhave low mag sizes compared to other Assault Rifles, they\u2019re getting a slight\nincrease to overall damage to compensate. DAHL SMGs had their Fire Rates\nadjusted down before launch but their damage was never sufficiently increased\nso they should feel more appropriate compared to other SMGs. And the Vladof\nHeavy Weapon damage has been increased to share in the full Heavy Weapon\ntreatment._\n\n  * Jakobs Assault Rifles Damage increased by 20%\n  * DAHL SMG Damage increased by 10%\n  * Vladof Heavy Weapon Damage increased by 25%\n  * E-Tech TEDIORE Shotgun Damage increased by 50%\n\n _Legendary Modifications_\n\n _We\u2019re going to be making a larger, comprehensive Legendary gear pass but we\nhave included the following changes. King\u2019s and Queen\u2019s Call were modified to\nlower the fire rate. The weapon has a limited burst shot count so overall feel\nof the gun isn\u2019t dramatically affected._\n\n  * King\u2019s and Queen\u2019s Call Fire Rate reduced by 50%\n  * Firestorm and Storm base Charge Times were reduced to 1 second (down from 2)\n\n# Graveward\n\n _Graveward\u2019s beam attacks did not properly scale based on level so at higher\nlevels, the two beam attacks hardly phased players. Players will find his\nattacks to be more lethal now. In addition, Graveward is a very large enemy\nand is too easily susceptible to elemental damage unlike the other large\nbosses. Elemental damage on Graveward is now greatly reduced but to\ncompensate, Graveward\u2019s overall health was reduced._\n\n  * Attacks of Graveward now scale based on level\n  * Reduced overall health by 20%\n  * Increased resistances to Elemental Damage  \n\\- Elemental Chance Resistance increased by 70%  \n\\- Elemental Resistances increased by 30%  \n\\- Elemental DoT Duration taken reduced by 30%\n\n# Miscellaneous Changes\n\n  *  _Hollow Point_ Guardian Rank has been temporarily disabled. We plan on addressing this further in a future patch.\n  * Vault Hunters should no longer scream when affected by a DoT while shields are active.\n  * Vending Machines will now be restocked with higher quality \u201cItems of the Day\u201d.\n  * Adjusted a visual concern on Maliwan Shotguns with Cryo Element.\n  * Legendary loot drops have been balanced throughout the game. Crew Challenge enemies will drop their intended specific loot, and some enemies like Troy and Rampager will be a bit more stingy and no longer drop Legendaries every kill.\n\n# Vault Hunter Adjustments\n\n _Zane_\n\n _Zane\u2019s gadgets were great at providing additional utility but lacked impact\nas players leveled up. We increased the Digi-Clone damage with all equipped\nweapon so the skill can scale better with players as they get to higher levels\nand harder content. The Drone requires a lot of player involvement to take\nfull advantage of its damage output and increasing the base damage as well as\nthe augments will greatly increase the Drone\u2019s versatility and reward players\neven more for using it effectively._\n\n  * Digi-Clone Damage Increased by 38%\n  * Drone Damage increased by 50%  \n _\\- Cryo Bullets_ damage penalty removed  \n _\\- Drone Rocket_ damage increased by 50%  \n _\\- Almighty Ordnance Rockets_ damage increased by 75%\n\n _Amara_\n\n  *  _Guardian Angel_ health restoration reduced from 100% to 50%\n  *  _Glamour_ damage penalty reduced from -30% to -10%\n\n _FL4K_\n\n _Guerillas in the Mist\u2019s bonuses greatly outweighed its penalty to the base\nskill. We don\u2019t want to remove the playstyle completely, but the overall\ndamage output had to be slightly adjusted because it was outperforming other\nbuilds. We\u2019re monitoring the changes and may make another change to the ammo\nreturn in a future patch._\n\n  *  _Guerillas in the Mist_ duration reduced from 8 seconds to 6 seconds\n  *  _Guerillas in the Mist_ Critical Damage Bonus reduced from 50% to 25%\n\n", "2019-09-26-borderlands-3-patch-sept-26": "Today we'll release an update to [Borderlands 3](https://borderlands.com/en-US/shop/borderlands-3-super-deluxe-edition) by or before 3:00 PM PDT that\nfixes a number of reported concerns:\n\n _Performance_\n\n  *  **[PC Only]** Reduced the amount of texture streaming that was occurring when aiming down sights.\n  * Addressed a reported concern where certain users with a lot of people in their friend's list saw more frequent hitching.\n  * Implementing General stability improvements.\n\n _General Fixes and Improvements_\n\n  * Addressed a reported issue where KillaVolt's Shield Storm attack does not disable the tiles around KillaVolt, resulting in the entire floor being activated (oops).\n  * Addressed a potential progression blocker in the mission \"Footsteps of Giants\".\n  * Addressed a reported issue where Guardian Rank had the potential to become non-functional and/or the player could potentially lose Guardian Rank tokens into the negatives.\n  * Modified vending machines so it will now sort items by rarity.\n  * Console FOV is now set to 75 by default.

Hot fixes generally are used to\nmake balance changes and are handled by the design team. Additional reported\nconcerns may affect other teams which may require that changes are made in a\ntrue content patch/title update. Together the Borderlands 3 teams are working\ntirelessly to release various patches or updates as soon as possible, however,\nwe didn't want to wait on balance changes just for the sake of appearances.\n\nWe are aware that the above list of changes may not include all concerns that\nsome players have reported experiencing, as detailed in the [Borderlands 3\nTroubleshooting and Optimization Guide](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2019-09-18-borderlands-3-troubleshooting-optimization-guide/).
