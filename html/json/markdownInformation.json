To help him understand the emotional rollercoaster that is Broken\nHearts Day, you\u2019ll need to blast the floating hearts that are popping up over\nbaddies\u2019 heads all over the galaxy. Maurice will reward you with sweet Broken\nHearts Day loot for your trouble, **including two level 53 weapons:**\n**Terminal Polyaimorous and Wedding Invitation**!\n\n#### Event Toggle\n\nFor the Vault Hunter who already has everything, or prefers their gameplay to\nbe more straightforward, you can now disable the Broken Hearts Day Event in\nthe main menu. This highly requested feature will be included for all future\nseasonal events as well.\n\n### Skippable Cutscenes\n\nWith this patch, you can now skip all cutscenes in the game, whether you\u2019ve\nseen the cutscene before or not, during solo play or by the host of your party\nduring multiplayer! Simply press any key during the scene and you\u2019ll be\nprompted to confirm the skip.\n\n### Level Cap increased to 53\n\nThe level cap has been increased to 53, providing everyone with 3 more skill\npoints to aim for! We are looking forward to seeing what interesting\ncombinations the community finds with their additional skills and will have\nmore to talk about in the future concerning level cap increases and character\ngrowth.\n\n### True Takedown Mode\n\nWe\u2019re introducing True Takedown Mode to the [Takedown at the Maliwan\nBlacksite](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2019-11-22-takedown-at-the-maliwan-blacksite/). As of this patch, there will be a way to re-enable the\noriginal version of the Takedown scaled to 4 players. Future Takedowns will\nalso launch with both modes enabled.\n\nThe default setting keeps the Takedown scaled depending on how many people are\nin your party. To turn back on 4-player scaling, toggle the new switch to the\nright of the Takedown door.\n\n### Guardian Ranks\n\nYou are now able to turn off individual Guardian Ranks or the whole system! If\nthere are any perks that aren\u2019t playing nice with your builds, you can now\ndisable them! Furthermore, for those who want to enjoy a vanilla leveling\nexperience, you have the ability to disable the entire system. This includes\nboth stat bonuses and all perks.\n\n **When the patch goes live, the Guardian Rank system will be turned off by\ndefault,** giving you a great opportunity to look through your perks to see if\nthere\u2019s anything new you want to try! _Note: while the Guardian Rank system is\nturned off, you will not be able to gain ranks._\n\n## Stadia\n\nWith this patch, Stadia is now caught up to the other platforms!

Below are the notes for\nboth today's patch and hotfix.\n\n#  **Notes for Patch 4**\n\n# New Content:\n\n **Takedown at the Maliwan Blacksite**\n\n  * Lorelei has recruited the Vault Hunters to destroy a top-secret weapon Maliwan has been developing at their Blacksite. You and your squad should prepare for an extreme challenge because this content is balanced for four players at level 50. You can gain access to the Blacksite via a mission found on [Sanctuary III](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2019-09-04-borderlands-3-sanctuary-iii/) after completing the main campaign with that character.\n  * Takedowns feature special rules not found in the rest of the game! Respawning is disabled, so make sure you and your co-op partners get Second Wind or you'll spectate until the team wipes. If you do die, you're not out permanently! Die during the first half, you'll get to rejoin your team if they defeat the Valkyrie Squad. If you're out the second half, but your team manages to defeat Wotan The Invincible, you'll get to respawn to enjoy the rewards you didn't completely earn!\n  * Make sure your squad is in the session before you throw the switch inside the Air Lock, or anyone who joins after the switch is thrown joins as a spectator!\n\n **Mayhem 4**\n\n  * Mayhem 4 is here for players looking for the toughest challenge in the game! Mayhem 4 adds another increase to enemy health, increases the loot drop chances, and adds a set of new Legendaries! Because the health value greatly increased, Mayhem 4 also slightly adjusts the random modifier system. Mayhem 4 will only roll one positive modifier for the player and one enemy bonus modifier. We want players to try different builds without severely hampering their ability to take down enemies in Mayhem 4. _Note that Mayhem 1-3 are unchanged._\n  * In addition to increasing enemy health and adjusting the modifiers, Mayhem 4 contains new Legendary weapons and class mods for players to hunt. These new pieces of gear will contribute to new builds and new ways to kill enemies!\n  * To support Mayhem 4, we changed the Mayhem station slightly. Players will activate Mayhem through the center pillar and increase or decrease Mayhem levels by using the pillars on each side. Looking forward, we will monitor the challenge of Mayhem 4 closely. We're working hard on Mayhem 2.0, which will add brand new gameplay additions to Mayhem Mode in the future. Until then, we hope you enjoy the challenge and new loot!\n\n **Bank Expansion**\n\nAll characters now begin the game with 20 bank slots instead of 10. The\nexisting Bank SDUs will give everyone a total of 100 available spaces.

We wanted to increase their\nviability for later levels of Mayhem while also targeting some passives that\nwere underperforming compared to some others. Iron Bear saw increases to the\nbase scaling and additional bonuses were added through passives and augments.\nWe allowed some of Zane's kill-skill bonuses to stack up to two times,\nincreasing their output under certain conditions. FL4K pets also saw some\nincreases over level to their damage so that they didn't feel underpowered for\nMayhem Mode. We are currently happy with the variety of Amara's builds, but we\nare always monitoring feedback and will adjust if necessary.\n\n **Moze**\n\n  * Iron Bear Damage increased per level, to a total of just under 150% at max level\n  * Desperate Measures now gives Iron Bear the bonus too\n  * Experimental Munitions - Iron Bear also deals bonus fire damage on critical hits\n  * Scorching RPM's also

them\n  * Increased Iron Bear Bubble Shield from 20% to 50% of Moze's health\n\n **Zane**\n\n  *  _SNTL_ damage scale increased by 2% per level\n  *  _Donnybrook, Pocket Full of Grenades, Cool Hand, Violent Violence,_ and _Violent Speed_ bonuses now stack twice\n  * Fixed _Violent Momentum_ to scale more at higher movement speeds\n  *  _Best Served Cold_ radius and damage increased by 2% per level\n  *  _Confident Confidence_ increased max weapon damage bonus from 20% to 35%\n  * Changed _Trick of the Light_ element to Cryo and increased bonus from 18% to 36%\n  *  _Borrowed Time_ duration increased from 15% to 30% per active skill\n  *  _Double Barrel_ 's bonus increased from 20% to 25%\n  *  _Quick Breather_ now restores 50% of the clone's health after a swap\n  *  _Pocket Full of Grenades_ bonus slightly decreased from 6.5% to 5% as it now stacks\n  *  _Violent Violence_ bonus slightly decreased from 4% to 3% as it now stacks\n\n **FL4K**\n\n  *  _Ambush Predator_ now has a HUD Icon when the buff is active\n  * Increased the pet damage to scale 10/5% per level instead of 9%\n  * Added pet damage to _Grim Harvest_ at 7% per level\n  * Added pet damage to _The Most Dangerous Game_ at 9% per level\n  * Added pet damage to _Interplanetary Stalker_ at 1% per stack, per level\n  * Added pet damage to _Furious Attack_ at 0.6% per stack\n  * Added pet damage to _The Fast and the Furryous_ at 10% per level\n  *  _Lick the Wounds_ gained a pet damage buff after reviving the player\n  * Increased pet damage for _Psycho Head on a Stick_ from 10% to 20%\n  * Increased damage in _Pack Tactics_ from 5% to 7% per level\n  * Adjusted _Megavore_ to not reward critical hit bonuses when receiving damage from self-damage\n\n# Stability\n\n  * Fixed multiple crashes that

We are gathering data, reading feedback, and\nworking toward improving all aspects of the game. Please keep submitting bug\nreports to [support.2k.com](https://support.2k.com/)!\n\n# Weapons\n\n **Flakker**\n\n  * Now consumes 1 ammo instead of 5.\n\n# Bug Fixes\n\n  * Addressed a reported bug with \"Space-Laser Tag\" which prevented some players from progressing to the next objective\n  * Atomic has been modified to no longer become invincible, as has been reported under certain conditions\n  * Modified Powerhouse Heavy's attacks to no longer damage players outside of the intended range\n  * Addressed a concern that Projected shields were taking too much damage from General Traunt's attacks\n  * Fixed the reported floating door frame in the Jakobs Theatre\n  * Addressed a reported potential progression blocker when Rhy's talks during \"Hostile Takeover\"\n  * Increased checkpoint sizes of New-U stations in multiple locations\n  * Included a modification so that Zane's Digi-Clone will no longer spawn into the cage in Slaughterstar 3000\n\nThose are a lot of notes to take in, and we're still hard at work addressing\nreported issues in Borderlands 3. But given that we're just about a month out\nfrom Borderlands 3's launch, we'd like to take this opportunity to outline our\nplans for future updates, including some of the community's most frequently\nrequested changes. There can always be unforeseen challenges when working on\npatches and hotfixes, so we'll keep you posted on more concrete release\ntimings as these updates continue to progress. Here's a look at some of the\nthings we're working to implement in future patches.\n\n# Performance and Stability\n\nGame performance and stability continue to be our top priorities. The first\nfruits of that labor will be released in our upcoming November patch, with\nvarious improvements game-wide. We've also been hard at work improving the\ngame's stability and more improvements in this regard are expected to be\nincluded in the November patch. Performance and stability will continue to be\nan ongoing effort with more fixes rolled out with each upcoming patch.\n\n# The Bank\n\nExpanding the bank has been the most consistently requested feature by the\ncommunity. We've heard you loud and clear and the groundwork for expanding the\nbank has already started. The first of several planned expansions will\ncoincide with the release of Takedown at Maliwan's Blacksite. Expect a\nsignificant bank expansion that will more than double the existing space.\nAdditional expansions to the bank will continue to be rolled out over future\nreleases.\n\n# Dedicated Loot Pools for Bosses\n\nSeveral of you have stated a desire to find gear more easily in the game. To\ndo that we are updating the loot pools (the data that determines what in-game\nitems drop) to ensure that more specific gear drops from bosses. That means\nyou'll be able to go to a specific boss to get the specific gear you're\nlooking for. We're working out which bosses get which gear right now and\nexpect this to be ready as part of the November patch as well.\n\n# Character Buffs\n\nIn the late stages of the game when Mayhem Mode is active, we've found that\nplayer companions (Moze's Iron Bear, FL4K's pets, and Zane's Digi-Clone/SNTL)\nare reportedly not performing as well as we had expected. To address this,\nwe're looking at how to adjust damage according to the relevant skills and\ngear. The goal here is to make sure we have as many viable character builds as\npossible.\n\n# Additional Mayhem Levels and Mayhem 2.0\n\nMayhem Mode has been a fantastic addition to the Borderlands world. After\nreceiving some great community feedback, we've been hard at work on a\nsignificant revamp that will introduce a host of improvements over several\nupcoming updates.\n\nThe first update will be released as part of the Takedown at Maliwan's\nBlacksite and includes the first new Mayhem Mode level, Mayhem 4. Expect a\nsignificant challenge when it debuts, with tougher enemies that reward players\nwith highly synergized character builds. A new batch of Legendary gear will\nalso only drop while in Mayhem 4 to reward those players who are truly up for\nthe challenge.\n\nLonger term we have plans to overhaul Mayhem Mode with more UI support, new\nMayhem Modifiers that change gameplay more dramatically, Mayhem playlists, new\nrewards, and additional levels of Mayhem to work through. We're excited about\nMayhem 2.0 and we'll talk more about it when we get a little closer to its\nrelease.\n\n# Vending Machines\n\nMarcus heard the outcry for more vending machines, so we're airdropping in\nsome more across multiple maps. Expect new ammo and health vending machines\noutside of a few boss arenas and a few in some of the bigger environments.\nBelow are the locations where the new vending machines will be appearing:\n\n  * Athenas\n  * Atlas HQ\n  * Skywell-27\n  * Lectra City\n  * Jakobs Estate\n  * Voracious Canopy\n  * Tazendeer Ruins\n  * The Pyre of Stars\n\n# Skippable Cinematics\n\nWe're currently investigating the best way to approach letting players skip\ncutscenes. This is much easier said than done. Under the hood, the game may\nactivate critical events based on cinematics. In order to make sure mission\nprogression isn't negatively impacted, we need to inspect each cinematic and\nmake sure those events still work correctly. We have a few ideas on how to\ntackle this problem and expect to have a solution soon.\n\n# Target Dummy\n\nNeed an easier way to test your gear? We're going to add a target dummy to the\nshooting range on Sanctuary III! We feel this is the best location since your\nbank is also on the ship. This way you can manage and test your builds on\nSanctuary III without having to travel anywhere else. You can expect to see\nthis sometime in December.\n\n# The Future\n\nThe list above is only a high-level look at what some of our teams are working\non. Stay tuned as we continue to add more information and additions to this\nlist. We here at Gearbox are excited about where Borderlands 3 is heading, and\nwe look forward to showing you all the content that's still to come!\n\n", "2019-10-17-borderlands-3-hotfixes-oct-17": "This week\u2019s [Borderlands 3](https://borderlands.com/en-US/shop/borderlands-3-super-deluxe-edition) hotfixes, which will be live on\nall platforms by or before 3:00 PM PDT today, adjust Legendary gear across all\nmanufacturers. Our goal with Legendary gear is to enable a large variety of\nplaystyles and builds for all characters. After looking through the data, we\nfound that that some pieces of Legendary gear were greatly outperforming\nothers and felt they were limiting builds instead of increasing them. In\naddition, some of the damage output of Legendary gear limited the growth in\ncombat engagements for the future so we tuned everything to an acceptable\nmedian. We expect all Vault Hunters to be able to create amazing builds and we\nwant to support that with more ways to grow and reach those power levels.\n\n# Weapon Hotfixes\n\n **Maliwan**\n\n  * Westergun damage increased by 25%\n  * ASMD damage increased by 28%\n  * Cutsman damage reduced by 25%\n\n **Tediore**\n\n  * Ten Gallon damage increased by 8%\n\n **Vladof**\n\n  * Sickle reload speed increased by 25%\n  * Faisor damage increased by 15%\n  * Infiniti damage increased by 40%\n  * Magnificent damage increased by 25%\n  * Jericho damage increased by 40%\n  * Lucian\u2019s Call accuracy and handling reduced\n  * Lyuda Critical Damage Bonus decreased by 30% and made a modification to address a reported bug that an extra bullet was spawned in the center\n\n _The Lyuda\u2019s functionality is to split the projectile from 1 to 3 after a\ncertain distance. It was reported that the original projectile was never\ndestroyed in the process of splitting so 1 projectile actually became 4.\nAddressing this concern effectively removed a full shot\u2019s worth of damage\nwhich auto-corrects the base damage of the weapon. Since we increased all\nsniper rifle critical damage bonus in a previous hotfix, we reduced some of\nthe critical damage bonus on the Lyuda._\n\n **Torgue**\n\n  * Try-Bolt damage increased by 25%\n  * Alchemist damage increased by 25%\n  * Devils Foursum damage increased by 13%\n  * Flakker now consumes the full magazine when fired and damage is reduced by 33%\n\n _Flakker was greatly outperforming other shotguns due to the number of\nprojectiles and the high rate of fire. We initially believed the resulting\nprojectile spread would cause most of the explosions to miss the target,\nhowever this turned out to be false, so we reduced the projectile damage and\nallowed the weapon to only fire once per magazine. This change encourages\nplayers to capitalize on different stat bonuses to maximize the weapon\u2019s\ndamage output._\n\n  * Laser-Sploder rocket projectiles spawn interval increased by 0.4 seconds\n\n **Jakobs**\n\n  * Maggie damage increased by 35%\n  * Hellwalker damage reduced by 8%\n\n **Hyperion**\n\n _We found that a couple of the Legendary Hyperion weaponry bypassed the\nHyperion manufacturer playstyle too easily making their bonuses greatly\noutweigh the penalties. The Butcher was drastically outperforming all metrics\nand we chose to reduce the damage in order to keep the fast fire rate._\n\n  * Conference Call damage increased by 15%\n  * Crossroad accuracy reduced and it now fires 3 projectiles instead of 4\n  * Butcher accuracy reduced and damage reduced by 25%\n\n **DAHL**\n\n  * Vanquisher damage increased by 20%\n\n **Children of the Vault**\n\n  * Skeksis damage increased by 15%\n  * Linoge damage increased by 20%\n  * Pain is Power damage increased by 25%\n\n **Atlas**\n\n  * Ruby\u2019s Wrath damage increased by 10%\n\n **Grenades**\n\n _Hex and Firestorm were calibrated to the wrong grenade modifier. These two\ngrenades were envisioned to specialize by applying elemental DoTs to targets.\nInstead they were resulting in large amounts of damage and the elemental DoTs\nwere minimal. We realize this is a drastic change on both of these grenades,\nbut we did not want to remove the spectacle of the grenade (number of grenades\nspawned, number of targets hit, etc.) and focused on allowing their core\nidentity to be emphasized instead of them continuing to just be high damage\ngrenades._\n\n  * Hunter-Seeker damage increased by 25%\n  * Hex grenade damage reduced by 70% and duration reduced to 3 seconds\n  * Firestorm damage reduced by 70%\n\n **Artifacts**\n\n _It was reported that the Legendary artifact, Elemental Projector, had a bug\nresulting in the max value being displayed at 183% instead of the actual max\nvalue of 113%. Therefore, we addressed the discrepancy and reduced the max\nvalue to 90%._\n\n  * Elemental Projector damage max roll reduced to 90%\n\n# Vault Hunter Adjustments\n\n _The current state of Moze\u2019s Iron Bear, Zane\u2019s Digi-Clone, and FL4K\u2019s pets\nhave made players focus on other elements besides those Vault Hunter\u2019s\nfundamental action skills in the late game. While longer term solutions to\nscaling their damage is explored, we have boosted the health of Iron Bear, the\nDigi-Clone, and the pets to make them more viable. We will have more to say\nabout long term solutions for these characters in the future._\n\n  *  _Iron Bear:_ health increased by 50%\n  * All pets\u2019 health increased by 50%\n  *  _Digi-Clone:_ health increased by 100%\n  * Addressed a bug with _Salvation_ where grenades were giving life-steal\n\n# Bug Fixes\n\n  * Psychos will now use their True Vault Hunter Mode name in True Vault Hunter Mode\n  * Removed the optional Rare Spawn missions from Galaxy Progress\n  * Addressed a reported bug where Completely Sane Sid didn\u2019t always become hostile when using FL4K\n  * Addressed a reported bug where Ratch would not properly spawn during \u201cRatch\u2019d Up\u201d, which potentially blocked completion of that side mission\n  * Included a modification so Lilith would continue to move toward the door in Shiv\u2019s confession chamber during \u201cFrom the Ground Up\u201d\n  * Lowered the chance for a weapon to drop from the Pachinko machine\n  * Included a modification so that Zane\u2019s Digi-Clone will no longer spawn into the cage in Cistern of Slaughter\n  * Shield Boosters were modified and are now set for autopickup\n  * An addition was introduced so Eridium chests are no longer listed as Red Chests in the ECHOcast extension on Sanctuary III\n\n", "2019-10-10-borderlands-3-hotfixes-oct-10": "This week's [Borderlands 3](https://borderlands.com/en-US/shop/borderlands-3-super-deluxe-edition) hotfixes, which will be live on\nall platforms by or before 3:00 PM PDT today, address some player character\npassive abilities, gear balance, and some quality-of-life issues across the\ngame. We're watching the character builds that players are creating and are\nlooking through all the different gear available to make sure that there is\nsomething for everyone. This week, and in the coming weeks, there will be\nfurther adjustments to gear with the hopes of creating even more build types.\nOur goal is to adjust some of the less-used Legendary gear to bring them to\nthe same level as some of the more popular options.\n\nIn addition, we are addressing reported bugs and are hard at work continuing\nto address other performance concerns. Thank you so much for your feedback and\nsupport. Please continue to submit any bugs you run into at\n[support.2k.com](https://support.2k.com/).\n\n# Vault Hunter Adjustments\n\n**Amara**\n\n _We addressed a concern that_ Alacrity _was only rewarding players one point\nworth of bonuses even if the player put in more than one point. In addition,\nwe wanted_ Phasegrasp _to be more accessible to all weapon types and play\nstyles, so we doubled the range to grasp an enemy._\n\n  * Putting points into _Alacrity_ now awards a reload speed bonus per rank\n  *  _Phasegrasp_ can now be used on targets further away and the cooldown is now instantly returned if a player misses\n\n **Moze**\n\n _The_ Bloodletter _class mod was creating some overwhelming synergies for\nMoze so we increased the delay and decreased the recharge rate of the shield\nto compensate. This should help encourage the intended use of this class mod,\nwhich is to heal shields manually, not automatically._ Means of Destruction\n_\u2019s re-trigger delay was adjusted again because the change limited other\nbuilds beyond creating infinite grenades. The infinite grenade bug will be\naddressed in a future patch but we wanted to enable other builds that use_\nMeans of Destruction _so we dramatically reduced the re-trigger delay to a\nreasonable number._\n\n  *  _Bloodletter_ Class Mod  \n\\- Increased the Recharge Delay by 150%  \n\\- Reduced the Recharge Rate by 50%\n\n  * Addressed a reported bug with _Close the Distance_ so the Action Skill Augment will now deal the intended Shock Damage\n  *  _Means of Destruction_ now has a re-trigger delay of 0.3 seconds\n\n **FL4K**\n\n _The_ Leave No Trace _change last week to FL4K was to forcefully inject the\nfunctionality of a cooldown into the ability. However, the value that was\nadded was never the intended the value. We dramatically lowered it to retain\nthe promise of the ability but with a cooldown that still allows players to\ngain ammo without dramatically removing a core aspect of a weapon\u2019s gameplay\nloop._\n\n  *  _Leave No Trace_ now has a re-trigger delay set to 0.3 seconds\n\n **Zane**\n\n  *  _Death Follows Close_ will correctly update several Kill Skills after unlocking this ability\n\n# Weapon Hotfixes\n\n  * The Lob's projectile tick damage is now 60% of base damage (up from 20%) and projectile speed decelerates faster to increase chances of hitting the same target multiple times\n  * Creeping Death damage increased by 200%\n  * Carrier damage increased by 60%\n  * Gunerang damage increased by 20%\n  * All Sniper Rifle Zoom Levels have been slightly reduced\n  * Long scopes on Jakobs, Children of the Vault, and DAHL Assault Rifles have also been slightly reduced\n  * Anointed Parts:  \n\\- When Zane swaps positions with his Digi-Clone, the damage gained is\nincreased to 130% (up from 75%)  \n\\- When FL4K hits a target with Rakks, the target now takes 100% increased\ndamage (up from 50%)  \n\\- The Anointed part \"Increased damage vs Badasses\" no longer heals the player\nand now correctly adds bonus damage to Badass enemies\n\n# Bug Fixes\n\n  * Pain, Terror, and Agonizer 9000 have been adjusted to have an increased chance to drop higher quality loot\n  * Addressed a reported bug with Dynasty Diner that could potentially halt mission progress for some players\n  * Addressed a reported concern that some players fell through the floors in various boss arenas\n  * Modified enemy spawn level discrepancies reported in the later parts of the campaign\n\n _We noticed that some enemies were spawning at lower levels than expected in\nthe later parts of the campaign.

To\nencourage more build diversity, we made some adjustments to FL4K and Moze this\nweek.\n\nWe also looked at a few boss fights and made balance changes to make their\ncombats more enjoyable. Finally, we went over some enemy behaviors that could\nhave affected mission progression and adjusted some attacks to happen with\nmore frequency.\n\n# Vault Hunter Adjustments\n\n **FL4K**\n\n _Rakk Attack!_ is great for constant damage output, especially when paired\nwith Anointed gear. The base skill still seems to be lacking, so _Rakk\nAttack!_ now has a guaranteed status effect on any enemy that it damages.\n_Leave No Trace_ was returning much more ammo than intended, and we have added\na re-trigger delay to keep its ammo return within expectation. _Barbaric Yawp_\nhas an increased bonus, as we didn\u2019t feel that the amount of investment had an\nequal payoff. In addition, we felt that FL4K\u2019s pets were demanding too much\nattention, which was interfering with players trying to stand still for any\nlength of time, so we disabled the ability for them to move you around.\n\n  *  _Rakk Attack!_ status effect chance as been increased to 100%.\n  *  _Leave No Trace_ now has a re-trigger delay of 2 seconds\n  *  _Barbaric Yawp_ stat bonus increased by 100%\n  * Pets no longer push around player characters\n  * \u201cTouch Pet\u201d prompt is now a lower priority and should no longer interfere with looting or vending machines\n\n **Moze**\n\nInfinite Grenades is not an intentional build for Moze\u2014even if it is\nhilarious. To lower the power (and spam) of this build, a re-trigger delay has\nbeen added to the grenade portion of _Means of Destruction_.\n\n  *  _Means of Destruction_ now has a re-trigger delay of 2 seconds\n\n# Miscellaneous Changes\n\n  * Adjusted the balance of Gigamind, Katagawa Ball, and Billy the Anointed\n\n _These three boss fights had concerns with their health and shields that made\ntheir combat loops more difficult than we intended. Gigamind had a little too\nmuch health, so that was reduced slightly. Katagawa Ball will no longer\nregenerate its shields; we found that while players contended with the adds\nduring the fight, it would unfairly regenerate its shield, negating the\nplayers\u2019 progress. Finally, Billy had 25% of his health removed; we agree that\nthis fight often dragged on needlessly. We will be monitoring each of these\nbosses and may make further adjustments in the future._\n\n  * Bloated Rakks no longer spawn so many Rakklesnakes\n\n _This change should make the Cistern of Slaughter in particular much more\nfun._\n\n  * Adjusted the cooldown values when they are displayed for Zane\u2019s skills\n  * Amara\u2019s _Glamour_ will now turn enemies on each other, as described in the Action Skill\n  * Modified the loot spawn for Sera of Supremacy\n  * Spiderant Emperors occasionally wouldn\u2019t drill back out of the ground, which created a potential progression blocker in the Proving Ground of Survival; we have adjusted this and the issue has been addressed\n  * Resolved an issue that could have prevented enemies from spawning while in Devil\u2019s Razor\n  * Lavender Crawly\u2019s physics were adjusted to prevent them exiting the world like a popped balloon\n  * Further safe guarded Apollo from being launched out of world as well\n  * The Rampager will no longer enter an idle at state at inappropriate times\n  * Saurian Slingers attacks were addressed\n  * Guardians now use all their attacks in Playthrough 2\n  * Guardian Wraiths now reliably use all their ranged attacks\n  * NPCs in the Slaughter maps were reported to sometimes attempt to automatically revive players in the arena. Going forward they will no longer attempt to revive players\n  * Minimized the glow effect when opening Eridian ammo chests, can more easily see the ammo inside when opened\n\n", "2019-09-27-borderlands-3-hot-fixes-sept-27": "This week\u2019s [Borderlands 3](https://borderlands.com/en-US/shop/borderlands-3-super-deluxe-edition) hotfixes, which will be live by or\nbefore 3:00 PM PDT today, target weapon & enemy balance, player characters,\nand adjusting chances of specific unique drops. Billions of guns were fired\nand after collecting some data, we wanted to balance some weapon types and\nweapon manufacturers. These adjustments are intended to even the playing field\nand increase build diversity for all Vault Hunters. Speaking of build\ndiversity, Zane has received a gadget upgrade and we\u2019re excited to see players\ncreate more unique builds with him! Many Crew Challenge enemies have specific\nloot drops but we received reports that some were not dropping them. We have\nmade some modifications so they now have an increased chance of dropping their\nunique gear in addition to any other gear that may drop!\n\n# Weapon Hotfixes\n\n _Sniper Rifles_\n\n _Sniper rifles deal high damage but felt a little cumbersome to use in\ncertain scenarios. This change will increase their overall damage and increase\nusability in more combat engagements._\n\n  * Critical Damage increased by 20%\n  * Fire Rate increased by 15%\n  * Time to Aim Down Sights (ADS) reduced by 15%\n  * Time to Equip reduced by 20%\n\n _Pistols_\n\n _Jakobs and Torgue Pistols were outperforming other manufacturers, dealing\ndamage to groups of enemies at a much higher rate than other pistols. This\nchange keeps their identity intact but reduces overall group control. TEDIORE,\nDAHL, and Children of the Vault Pistols have manufacturer penalties that\naffected their overall damage. Increasing their overall damage will overcome\nsome of the penalties while retaining their unique gameplay style and feel._\n\n  * Increased damage on all TEDIORE Pistols by 15%\n  * Increased damage on all DAHL Pistols by 15%\n  * Increased damage on all Children of the Vault Pistols by 20%\n  * Reduced damage on Jakobs Pistols by 15%\n  * Reduced damage on Torgue Pistols by 10%\n\n _Maliwan Manufacturer_\n\n _Maliwan weapons had reduced overall damage because they applied elemental\nDoTs at a rate and damage greatly above other manufacturers. This effect was\ntoned down before launch, but the overall damage was not sufficiently adjusted\nto compensate for the reduction in elemental DoTs. We\u2019re adding back some of\nthe overall damage and making the weapons faster so elemental builds can\nreally take advantage of Maliwan weaponry._\n\n  * All Maliwan Weapon Damage increased by 25%\n  * All Maliwan Weapon Fire Rate increased by 20%\n\n _Atlas Manufacturer_\n\n _Atlas weapons relied on a game loop that we felt gave players a greater\nadvantage when used correctly. Turns out the loop is not used if the damage\ndoesn\u2019t compensate for the time to set up. So now damage on Atlas weapons\nshould facilitate players using them in general on top of feeling badass when\nthey take advantage of Atlas technology._\n\n  * All Atlas Weapon Damage increased by 25%\n\n _Miscellaneous Adjustments_\n\n _The Jakobs Assault Rifle change was to differentiate the Assault Rifle from\nthe pistol as more of a mid to long range powerhouse. Since the Assault Rifles\nhave low mag sizes compared to other Assault Rifles, they\u2019re getting a slight\nincrease to overall damage to compensate. DAHL SMGs had their Fire Rates\nadjusted down before launch but their damage was never sufficiently increased\nso they should feel more appropriate compared to other SMGs. And the Vladof\nHeavy Weapon damage has been increased to share in the full Heavy Weapon\ntreatment._\n\n  * Jakobs Assault Rifles Damage increased by 20%\n  * DAHL SMG Damage increased by 10%\n  * Vladof Heavy Weapon Damage increased by 25%\n  * E-Tech TEDIORE Shotgun Damage increased by 50%\n\n _Legendary Modifications_\n\n _We\u2019re going to be making a larger, comprehensive Legendary gear pass but we\nhave included the following changes. King\u2019s and Queen\u2019s Call were modified to\nlower the fire rate. The weapon has a limited burst shot count so overall feel\nof the gun isn\u2019t dramatically affected._\n\n  * King\u2019s and Queen\u2019s Call Fire Rate reduced by 50%\n  * Firestorm and Storm base Charge Times were reduced to 1 second (down from 2)\n\n# Graveward\n\n _Graveward\u2019s beam attacks did not properly scale based on level so at higher\nlevels, the two beam attacks hardly phased players. Players will find his\nattacks to be more lethal now. In addition, Graveward is a very large enemy\nand is too easily susceptible to elemental damage unlike the other large\nbosses. Elemental damage on Graveward is now greatly reduced but to\ncompensate, Graveward\u2019s overall health was reduced._\n\n  * Attacks of Graveward now scale based on level\n  * Reduced overall health by 20%\n  * Increased resistances to Elemental Damage  \n\\- Elemental Chance Resistance increased by 70%  \n\\- Elemental Resistances increased by 30%  \n\\- Elemental DoT Duration taken reduced by 30%\n\n# Miscellaneous Changes\n\n  *  _Hollow Point_ Guardian Rank has been temporarily disabled. We plan on addressing this further in a future patch.\n  * Vault Hunters should no longer scream when affected by a DoT while shields are active.\n  * Vending Machines will now be restocked with higher quality \u201cItems of the Day\u201d.\n  * Adjusted a visual concern on Maliwan Shotguns with Cryo Element.\n  * Legendary loot drops have been balanced throughout the game. Crew Challenge enemies will drop their intended specific loot, and some enemies like Troy and Rampager will be a bit more stingy and no longer drop Legendaries every kill.\n\n# Vault Hunter Adjustments\n\n _Zane_\n\n _Zane\u2019s gadgets were great at providing additional utility but lacked impact\nas players leveled up. We increased the Digi-Clone damage with all equipped\nweapon so the skill can scale better with players as they get to higher levels\nand harder content. The Drone requires a lot of player involvement to take\nfull advantage of its damage output and increasing the base damage as well as\nthe augments will greatly increase the Drone\u2019s versatility and reward players\neven more for using it effectively._\n\n  * Digi-Clone Damage Increased by 38%\n  * Drone Damage increased by 50%  \n _\\- Cryo Bullets_ damage penalty removed  \n _\\- Drone Rocket_ damage increased by 50%  \n _\\- Almighty Ordnance Rockets_ damage increased by 75%\n\n _Amara_\n\n  *  _Guardian Angel_ health restoration reduced from 100% to 50%\n  *  _Glamour_ damage penalty reduced from -30% to -10%\n\n _FL4K_\n\n _Guerillas in the Mist\u2019s bonuses greatly outweighed its penalty to the base\nskill. We don\u2019t want to remove the playstyle completely, but the overall\ndamage output had to be slightly adjusted because it was outperforming other\nbuilds. We\u2019re monitoring the changes and may make another change to the ammo\nreturn in a future patch._\n\n  *  _Guerillas in the Mist_ duration reduced from 8 seconds to 6 seconds\n  *  _Guerillas in the Mist_ Critical Damage Bonus reduced from 50% to 25%\n\n", "2019-09-26-borderlands-3-patch-sept-26": "Today we'll release an update to [Borderlands 3](https://borderlands.com/en-US/shop/borderlands-3-super-deluxe-edition) by or before 3:00 PM PDT that\nfixes a number of reported concerns:\n\n _Performance_\n\n  *  **[PC Only]** Reduced the amount of texture streaming that was occurring when aiming down sights.\n  * Addressed a reported concern where certain users with a lot of people in their friend's list saw more frequent hitching.\n  * Implementing General stability improvements.\n\n _General Fixes and Improvements_\n\n  * Addressed a reported issue where KillaVolt's Shield Storm attack does not disable the tiles around KillaVolt, resulting in the entire floor being activated (oops).\n  * Addressed a potential progression blocker in the mission \"Footsteps of Giants\".\n  * Addressed a reported issue where Guardian Rank had the potential to become non-functional and/or the player could potentially lose Guardian Rank tokens into the negatives.\n  * Modified vending machines so it will now sort items by rarity.\n  * Console FOV is now set to 75 by default.

They're special again.\n  * Removed pain-sounds from Troy for his boss fight.\n\nHotfixes are applied at the Game Menu when you start the game. To ensure that\nthe hotfix has been applied, go to the in-game menu and see if \"Updates are\navailable\" is showing.\n\nWe know players have enjoyed a lot of our unique items and might be worried\nabout the changes to Mayhem Mode. Mayhem Mode will still greatly increase\nhigher rarity drop rates across all the worlds in Borderlands 3. The changes\nmade in Mayhem Mode today, specifically on Chupacabratch and Loot Tinks, were\nmade to spread some of the glory of loot explosions to the other areas and\nother enemies to hunt. We want Vault Hunters to hunt for unique items across\nall the worlds. That is the core promise of Mayhem Mode. The targeted\nadjustments seek to keep the grind fresh while still retaining an increase to\nunique drops for all parts of the game. We will be closely monitoring the\nchanges to make sure players are still enjoying all the unique gear in the\ngame.\n\nIn between the larger patches that will continue to expand and improve the\ngame\u2014the first one of those coming next week\u2014we're able to make more minor\nadjustments via these hot fixes or 'micropatches' to improve and fine-tune\nyour experience at a quicker pace. We'll continue to roll out these\nincremental improvements while evaluating gameplay data and identifying\nnecessary balance adjustments, and will be keeping record of all patches on\nour site.\n\nWe are hard at work investigating issues that have been reported, including\nperformance concerns and potential major bugs. Hot fixes generally are used to\nmake balance changes and are handled by the design team. Additional reported\nconcerns may affect other teams which may require that changes are made in a\ntrue content patch/title update. Together the Borderlands 3 teams are working\ntirelessly to release various patches or updates as soon as possible, however,\nwe didn't want to wait on balance changes just for the sake of appearances.\n\nWe are aware that the above list of changes may not include all concerns that\nsome players have reported experiencing, as detailed in the [Borderlands 3\nTroubleshooting and Optimization Guide](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2019-09-18-borderlands-3-troubleshooting-optimization-guide/). Thank\nyou for your continued support.\n\n"}
