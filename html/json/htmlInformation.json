After buffing weapons, we started looking at how class mods were impacting the build diversity of the Vault Hunters. After investigating community feedback, we developed these changes to make more class mods viable for Zane in the end game. Most of the passive skill buffs changed today are used by class mods that had been underperforming. Additional changes to Zane are already planned, with some coming in future hotfixes and patches.</p><h1>Skill Changes</h1><p><strong>Cold Bore</strong></p><ul><li>Increased bonus damage</li></ul><p>This skill only provides extra damage on the first bullet of a weapon swap. This bonus happens infrequently by nature, so we have massively buffed the damage. With this change, we are interested to see new builds centered around small magazine sizes, sniper rifles, and more.</p><p><strong>Duct Tape Mod</strong></p><ul><li>Decreased grenade cooldown by half</li></ul><p>We found that the value of this passive skill was limited by the cooldown between each grenade, so we've cut that in half. Players will need to be conscious of the cooldown time and type of grenade mod they equipped to get maximum value out of this passive skill.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Like a Ghost</strong></p><ul><li>Increased chance to ignore a bullet</li><li>Increased the bonus for each active action skill</li></ul><p>The stacking bonus only occurs each time one of Zane\u2019s action skills is activated.

You will switch into this alternate firing mode like any other weapon and will see purple effects when firing the Fabricator.</p><h1>Mission Rewards available in Veteran Rewards Vending Machine</h1><p>Players can now purchase previously rewarded mission rewards in the Veteran Rewards Machine just outside of Crazy Earl\u2019s door on Sanctuary III. As missions are completed, their rewards are added to the pool and can be purchased using Eridium!</p><h1>Legendary Gear available in Vending Machines</h1><p>We have rebalanced vending machines based on community feedback. Vending machines of all types have a small chance of providing Legendary gear for purchase. We\u2019ve also removed Uncommon (green) Rarity gear from the Item of the Day pool.</p><h1>Chests and Badass reward adjustments</h1><p>The quality of rewards found in chests and dropped from Badass enemies have been subtly buffed. Our goal is to make sure chests feel rewarding and exciting, and players feel properly rewarded for defeating difficult enemies.</p><h1>Dedicated loot pool adjustments</h1><p>The dedicated loot pools for bosses have been given a dramatic overhaul in hopes of making for a more reliable and satisfying farming experience. Most bosses have two pieces of gear assigned to them, though there are exceptions. To reach this goal, we enabled respawning on the following bosses and reshuffled gear between bosses more evenly.</p><ul><li>Dumptruck</li><li>Undertaker</li><li>Mincemeat</li><li>Buttmunch and Trufflemunch</li><li>Sheega</li><li>Rohner</li><li>Rax</li><li>Max</li><li>Archer Rowe</li><li>Bloodshine</li><li>Muldock, the Anointed</li><li>Artemis</li><li>Apollo</li><li>King Bobo</li><li>King Gnasher</li><li>Anointed X2</li><li>Anointed X3</li><li>Anointed X4</li><li>Azalea</li><li>Preston</li></ul><h1>Anointment pool adjustments</h1><p>To further improve the farming experience, we examined the Anointment pool and determined some weren\u2019t engaging the community as we hoped. Given the depth of the pool, we have removed the following 21 Anointments. Any gear that currently has these Anointments will continue to function properly, but gear dropped after this update will no longer roll with these Anointments.</p><ul><li>While Airborne, Critical Damage is increased 25%</li><li>While Airborne, Damage is increased by 30%</li><li>While Airborne, Fire Rate is increased 20%</li><li>While Airborne, Accuracy and Handling are increased by 75%</li><li>While Sliding, Damage is increased by 40%</li><li>While Sliding, Accuracy and Handling are increased by 50%</li><li>While Sliding, Fire Rate is increased by 25%</li><li>While Sliding, building up energy that refills a portion of your shields.</li><li>While an Action Skill is Active, reduce all incoming damage by a small amount</li><li>While an Action Skill is Active, 250% of health damage taken is returned to the attacker as shock damage. \u00a0</li><li>On Action Skill End, Critical Damage is increased by 25% for a short time</li><li>On Action Skill End, create a\u00a0cyber spike\u00a0that damages nearby enemies</li><li>On Action Skill End, spawn a healing pool for several seconds</li><li>On Action Skill End, Fire rate is increased by 11%, &amp; reload speed by 26% for a short time</li><li>On Action Skill End, Weapon Accuracy &amp; Handling are greatly increased for a short time</li><li>On Action Skill End, Movement speed is increased by 5% for a short time</li><li>On Action Skill End, 30% of damage taken is returned to the attacker for a short time.</li><li>After exiting Iron Bear, do not consume ammo for 5 seconds</li><li>After using Phaseslam, damage taken is reduced by 20% and movespeed is increased by 12%</li><li>After using Phasegrasp, Weapon Accuracy and Handling are greatly increased</li></ul><h1>A note on drop rates</h1><p>A few bosses have had some minor tweaks made to improve their looting experience, but we have left most of the drop rates unchanged. With the thinning of the dedicated loot pools and the removal of 21 Anointments, we decided to observe these changes first then make changes as needed in the future.</p><h1>Stability</h1><ul><li>Addressed a reported crash that could occur in splitscreen</li><li>Reduced the number of projectiles that spawn due to damage dealt when using multiple elements on enemies and limited the number of times projectiles bounce to 4\u00a0</li></ul><p><em>We have adjusted how projectiles from damage events spawn. We found spikes in stability and performance concerns when too many elemental projectiles were spawning during gameplay.

As part of that change, we need to adjust gear to reflect that. With the decrease in enemy health, shield, and armor in later levels of Mayhem, all the gear you have currently will feel more effective as you take down enemies in those higher levels. SMGs have proven to be one of the most popular weapon types, so we\u2019ve focused on them with this update. We decided that this amount of change was all we were comfortable with when paired with the scaling changes.\u00a0We will observe player feedback over the coming weeks and likely make further adjustments as needed.</p><p><strong>Weapon Buffs</strong></p><p><em>The number of viable SMGs felt low, compared to the relative depth of weapons of that type.\u00a0 As a result, several them have had damage increases this week.</em></p><ul><li>Increased weapons damage on Bitch</li><li>Increased weapons damage on Handsome Jackhammer</li><li>Increased weapons damage on Devoted</li><li>Increased weapons damage on Cloud Kill</li><li>Increased weapons damage on Tsunami</li><li>Increased weapons damage on Ten Gallon</li><li>Increased melee damage bonus on Ripper</li></ul><p><em>The Ripper\u2019s melee damage bonus wasn\u2019t providing enough incentive to execute its intended loop.\u00a0 We\u2019ve buffed the damage on the melee strike.</em></p><ul><li>Increased weapon damage on Vanquisher</li></ul><p><em>The base damage for the Vanquisher and its bonus damage while sliding have been buffed.\u00a0Like the Ripper, its core loop wasn\u2019t being used as the slide bonus wasn\u2019t significant enough prior to this change.</em></p><ul><li>Increased bonus damage while sliding on Vanquisher</li></ul><p><em>The Ripper and Vanquisher should be very effective now when embracing their unique loops.</em></p><p><strong>Weapon Nerfs</strong></p><p>We found that a few pieces of gear were overperforming or not working as intended, which unintentionally pushed players into builds exclusively using them. It also allowed players to bypass the intended growth of moving up the Mayhem Levels over time.\u00a0 By lowering these values and addressing some data, players should feel able to experiment with other pieces of gear.</p><p><strong>Sandhawk</strong></p><p>The Sandhawk was creating too many particle systems which we found creating issues related to performance. It also was creating too much damage relative to other sniper rifles. To combat this, we\u2019ve made the following changes.</p><ul><li>Increased Shot Cost from 2 to 3 \u2013 We\u2019ve increased the cost of firing the weapon, so that players have to more thoughtfully manage ammo.\u00a0 With the additional SDUs that were added in The Revenge of the Cartels patch, players should still be able to use this weapon quite a bit.</li><li>Removed 2 projectiles \u2013 As stated, the performance cost of this weapon was too high, so we\u2019ve removed two particle systems from each shot.\u00a0 This also removes some damage output from the weapon.</li><li>Increased Accuracy Spread \u2013 To make up for the difference for the missing projectiles, we\u2019ve spread out the pattern, so it still covers the same space.</li><li>Lowered lifetime of projectiles \u2013 Too many active particle systems from consecutive shots was really hurting performance, so we\u2019ve lowered the lifespan of the projectile.</li><li>Increased projectile speed \u2013 It was important to use to keep the weapon still effective in combat, so to counter the lowered lifetime of the projectiles, we\u2019ve sped them up.\u00a0 The result is a weapon that still feels as effective as before, and even more responsive.</li></ul><p><strong>Yellowcake</strong></p><p>We discovered an unfortunate issue with the Yellowcake that effectively added an extra 100% damage beyond its intended output.\u00a0We are fixing it today.</p><ul><li>Changed Damage Scaling \u2013 The wrong scaling math was applying to the Yellowcake, greatly increasing its damage beyond its intended value.\u00a0 We are changing it to use intended math.</li><li>Split Projectile Damage Decrease \u2013 We are lowering the damage of each of its split projectiles as they were overperforming as well.</li></ul><p><strong>Kaoson</strong></p><p>The Kaoson was providing more power than intended, which made it the go-to SMG.\u00a0 With today\u2019s changes it should still provide plenty of damage that focuses on explosive damage bonuses, but not quite at the scale as in the past.</p><ul><li>Accuracy Impulse Increased \u2013 Its accuracy allowed players to deal pin-point damage, then with the added explosive damage, it was further maximizing output.\u00a0We are increasing the accuracy impulse to account for the explosive damage bonus better.</li><li>Max Accuracy Increased \u2013 At full auto, the spread proved exceedingly tight, again allowing more damage to be maximized than we intended.\u00a0 We\u2019ve increased the maximum accordingly.</li><li>Critical Damage Reduced \u2013 The explosive damage provided by this weapon allows critical hits more frequently, so we are lowering its critical bonus by a small amount.</li><li>Base Damage Decreased \u2013 As the Kaoson basically has two points of damage\u2014the initial bullet, and then the explosive round\u2014it was providing way more damage than a typical SMG.\u00a0 We\u2019re lowering the base damage to better account for its dual damage feature.</li></ul><p><strong>Anointment Buffs</strong></p><p>Several Anointments in the game were not providing enough value, effectively making them non-viable for players.\u00a0 In an effort to increase build diversity, we are buffing a number of Anointments.</p><ul><li>Airborne Anointments \u2013 We\u2019ve increased the effectiveness of the While Airborne Damage, Critical Damage, and Fire Rate Anointment.\u00a0 The Airborne Fire Rate Anointment had a bug as well, which is being fixed to substantially improve this Anointment.\u00a0 We\u2019re anxious to see what builds will be used in Takedown at the Guardian Breach in particular.</li><li>Slide Fire Rate \u2013 It had a bug as well that prevented it from providing the intended bonus; we\u2019ve resolved that in these hotfixes.</li><li>Action Skill End \u2013 A number of these types of Anointments have been buffed to make them more useful for more builds.\u00a0 Fire Rate, Next 2 Mag Bonus Damage, and Splash Damage have all received damage increases.</li><li>Auto Bear Active Incendiary Damage \u2013 This has received a significant buff to make Iron Bear builds more effective.</li></ul>", "2020-05-28-borderlands-3-hotfixes-may-28": "<p></p><p/><p>Today we will release a hotfix for <a href=\"https://borderlands.com/en-US/shop/borderlands-3-super-deluxe-edition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Borderlands 3</a>, which will be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PST.

Below are the notes for today\u2019s patch and hotfixes.</p><h1><strong>PATCH NOTES</strong></h1><h3>Broken Hearts Day Event</h3><p>Maurice, your sentient Saurian shipmate on Sanctuary III, is continuing his study of humanity\u2019s customs, and has taken an interest in our strange courting rituals. To help him understand the emotional rollercoaster that is Broken Hearts Day, you\u2019ll need to blast the floating hearts that are popping up over baddies\u2019 heads all over the galaxy. Maurice will reward you with sweet Broken Hearts Day loot for your trouble, <strong>including two level 53 weapons:</strong> <strong>Terminal Polyaimorous and Wedding Invitation</strong>!\u00a0</p><h4>Event Toggle</h4><p>For the Vault Hunter who already has everything, or prefers their gameplay to be more straightforward, you can now disable the Broken Hearts Day Event in the main menu. This highly requested feature will be included for all future seasonal events as well.</p><h3>Skippable Cutscenes</h3><p>With this patch, you can now skip all cutscenes in the game, whether you\u2019ve seen the cutscene before or not, during solo play or by the host of your party during multiplayer! Simply press any key during the scene and you\u2019ll be prompted to confirm the skip.</p><h3>Level Cap increased to 53</h3><p>The level cap has been increased to 53, providing everyone with 3 more skill points to aim for! We are looking forward to seeing what interesting combinations the community finds with their additional skills and will have more to talk about in the future concerning level cap increases and character growth.</p><h3>True Takedown Mode</h3><p>We\u2019re introducing True Takedown Mode to the <a href=\"https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2019-11-22-takedown-at-the-maliwan-blacksite/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Takedown at the Maliwan Blacksite</a>. As of this patch, there will be a way to re-enable the original version of the Takedown scaled to 4 players. Future Takedowns will also launch with both modes enabled.</p><p>The default setting keeps the Takedown scaled depending on how many people are in your party. To turn back on 4-player scaling, toggle the new switch to the right of the Takedown door.</p><h3>Guardian Ranks</h3><p>You are now able to turn off individual Guardian Ranks or the whole system! If there are any perks that aren\u2019t playing nice with your builds, you can now disable them! Furthermore, for those who want to enjoy a vanilla leveling experience, you have the ability to disable the entire system. This includes both stat bonuses and all perks.</p><p><strong>When the patch goes live, the Guardian Rank system will be turned off by default,</strong> giving you a great opportunity to look through your perks to see if there\u2019s anything new you want to try! <em>Note: while the Guardian Rank system is turned off, you will not be able to gain ranks.</em></p><h2>Stadia</h2><p>With this patch, Stadia is now caught up to the other platforms! Stadia players can now access <a href=\"https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2019-11-20-moxxi-s-heist-of-the-handsome-jackpot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Moxxi\u2019s Heist of The Handsome

Below are the notes for both today's patch and hotfix.</p><h1><strong>Notes for Patch 4</strong></h1><h1>New Content:</h1><p><strong>Takedown at the Maliwan Blacksite</strong></p><ul><li>Lorelei has recruited the Vault Hunters to destroy a top-secret weapon Maliwan has been developing at their Blacksite. You and your squad should prepare for an extreme challenge because this content is balanced for four players at level 50. You can gain access to the Blacksite via a mission found on <a href=\"https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2019-09-04-borderlands-3-sanctuary-iii/\">Sanctuary III</a> after completing the main campaign with that character.</li><li>Takedowns feature special rules not found in the rest of the game! Respawning is disabled, so make sure you and your co-op partners get Second Wind or you'll spectate until the team wipes. If you do die, you're not out permanently! Die during the first half, you'll get to rejoin your team if they defeat the Valkyrie Squad. If you're out the second half, but your team manages to defeat Wotan The Invincible, you'll get to respawn to enjoy the rewards you didn't completely earn!</li><li>Make sure your squad is in the session before you throw the switch inside the Air Lock, or anyone who joins after the switch is thrown joins as a spectator!</li></ul><p><strong>Mayhem 4</strong></p><ul><li>Mayhem 4 is here for players looking for the toughest challenge in the game! Mayhem 4 adds another increase to enemy health, increases the loot drop chances, and adds a set of new Legendaries! Because the health value greatly increased, Mayhem 4 also slightly adjusts the random modifier system. Mayhem 4 will only roll one positive modifier for the player and one enemy bonus modifier. We want players to try different builds without severely hampering their ability to take down enemies in Mayhem 4. <em>Note that Mayhem 1-3 are unchanged. </em></li><li>In addition to increasing enemy health and adjusting the modifiers, Mayhem 4 contains new Legendary weapons and class mods for players to hunt. These new pieces of gear will contribute to new builds and new ways to kill enemies!</li><li>To support Mayhem 4, we changed the Mayhem station slightly. Players will activate Mayhem through the center pillar and increase or decrease Mayhem levels by using the pillars on each side. Looking forward, we will monitor the challenge of Mayhem 4 closely. We're working hard on Mayhem 2.0, which will add brand new gameplay additions to Mayhem Mode in the future. Until then, we hope you enjoy the challenge and new loot!</li></ul><p><strong>Bank Expansion</strong></p><p>All characters now begin the game with 20 bank slots instead of 10. The existing Bank SDUs will give everyone a total of 100 available spaces. An additional 10 Bank SDUs are available to purchase in Marcus's shop on Sanctuary III using the in-game cash currency, each awarding 20 spaces, for a grand total of 300 total bank spaces!</p><p><strong>Dedicated Loot Pools for Bosses</strong></p><p>All bosses have been updated with new loot pools that give them dedicated Legendary items to drop. Players can now discover which bosses drop their favorite gear and more easily farm their favorite items. Let the hunt begin!</p><p><strong>Additional Vending Machines</strong></p><p>The following environments have received additional vending machines. They can typically be found before bosses or the mid waypoint in larger environments:</p><ul><li>Athenas</li><li>Atlas HQ</li><li>Lectra City</li><li>Jakobs Estate</li><li>Voracious Canopy</li><li>Tazendeer Ruins</li><li>The Pyre of Stars</li></ul><p><strong>Target Dummy</strong></p><p>Players can take out their aggression, or test their gear, on a Handsome Jack target inside the shooting range on Sanctuary III.</p><h1>End Game Character Balance</h1><p>For this patch, we adjusted many passives involving companions such as Iron Bear, Digi-Clone, and FL4K pets in general. We wanted to increase their viability for later levels of Mayhem while also targeting some passives that were underperforming compared to some others. Iron Bear saw increases to the base scaling and additional bonuses were added through passives and augments. We allowed some of Zane's kill-skill bonuses to stack up to two times, increasing their output under certain conditions. FL4K pets also saw some increases over level to their damage so that they didn't feel underpowered for Mayhem Mode. We are currently happy with the variety of Amara's builds, but we are always monitoring feedback and will adjust if necessary.</p><p><strong>Moze </strong></p><ul><li>Iron Bear Damage increased per

But given that we're just about a month out from Borderlands 3's launch, we'd like to take this opportunity to outline our plans for future updates, including some of the community's most frequently requested changes. There can always be unforeseen challenges when working on patches and hotfixes, so we'll keep you posted on more concrete release timings as these updates continue to progress. Here's a look at some of the things we're working to implement in future patches.</p><h1>Performance and Stability</h1><p>Game performance and stability continue to be our top priorities. The first fruits of that labor will be released in our upcoming November patch, with various improvements game-wide. We've also been hard at work improving the game's stability and more improvements in this regard are expected to be included in the November patch. Performance and stability will continue to be an ongoing effort with more fixes rolled out with each upcoming patch.</p><h1>The Bank</h1><p>Expanding the bank has been the most consistently requested feature by the community. We've heard you loud and clear and the groundwork for expanding the bank has already started. The first of several planned expansions will coincide with the release of Takedown at Maliwan's Blacksite. Expect a significant bank expansion that will more than double the existing space. Additional expansions to the bank will continue to be rolled out over future releases.</p><h1>Dedicated Loot Pools for Bosses</h1><p>Several of you have stated a desire to find gear more easily in the game. To do that we are updating the loot pools (the data that determines what in-game items drop) to ensure that more specific gear drops from bosses. That means you'll be able to go to a specific boss to get the specific gear you're looking for. We're working out which bosses get which gear right now and expect this to be ready as part of the November patch as well.</p><h1>Character Buffs</h1><p>In the late stages of the game when Mayhem Mode is active, we've found that player companions (Moze's Iron Bear, FL4K's pets, and Zane's Digi-Clone/SNTL) are reportedly not performing as well as we had expected. To address this, we're looking at how to adjust damage according to the relevant skills and gear. The goal here is to make sure we have as many viable character builds as possible.</p><h1>Additional Mayhem Levels and Mayhem 2.0</h1><p>Mayhem Mode has been a fantastic addition to the Borderlands world. After receiving some great community feedback, we've been hard at work on a significant revamp that will introduce a host of improvements over several upcoming updates.</p><p>The first update will be released as part of the Takedown at Maliwan's Blacksite and includes the first new Mayhem Mode level, Mayhem 4. Expect a significant challenge when it debuts, with tougher enemies that reward players with highly synergized character builds. A new batch of Legendary gear will also only drop while in Mayhem 4 to reward those players who are truly up for the challenge.</p><p>Longer term we have plans to overhaul Mayhem Mode with more UI support, new Mayhem Modifiers that change gameplay more dramatically, Mayhem playlists, new rewards, and additional levels of Mayhem to work through. We're excited about Mayhem 2.0 and we'll talk more about it when we get a little closer to its release.</p><h1>Vending Machines</h1><p>Marcus heard the outcry for more vending machines, so we're airdropping in some more across multiple maps. Expect new ammo and health vending machines outside of a few boss arenas and a few in some of the bigger environments. Below are the locations where the new vending machines will be appearing:</p><ul><li>Athenas</li><li>Atlas HQ</li><li>Skywell-27</li><li>Lectra City</li><li>Jakobs Estate</li><li>Voracious Canopy</li><li>Tazendeer Ruins</li><li>The Pyre of Stars</li></ul><h1>Skippable Cinematics</h1><p>We're currently investigating the best way to approach letting players skip cutscenes. This is much easier said than done. Under the hood, the game may activate critical events based on cinematics. In order to make sure mission progression isn't negatively impacted, we need to inspect each cinematic and make sure those events still work correctly. We have a few ideas on how to tackle this problem and expect to have a solution soon.</p><h1>Target Dummy</h1><p>Need an easier way to test your gear? We're going to add a target dummy to the shooting range on Sanctuary III! We feel this is the best location since your bank is also on the ship. This way you can manage and test your builds on Sanctuary III without having to travel anywhere else. You can expect to see this sometime in December.</p><h1>The Future</h1><p>The list above is only a high-level look at what some of our teams are working on. Stay tuned as we continue to add more information and additions to this list. We here at Gearbox are excited about where Borderlands 3 is heading, and we look forward to showing you all the content that's still to come!</p>", "2019-10-17-borderlands-3-hotfixes-oct-17": "<p></p><p/><p>This week\u2019s <a href=\"https://borderlands.com/en-US/shop/borderlands-3-super-deluxe-edition\">Borderlands 3</a> hotfixes, which will be live on all platforms by or before 3:00 PM PDT today, adjust Legendary gear across all manufacturers. Our goal with Legendary gear is to enable a large variety of playstyles and builds for all characters. After looking through the data, we found that that some pieces of Legendary gear were greatly outperforming others and felt they were limiting builds instead of increasing them. In addition, some of the damage output of Legendary gear limited the growth in combat engagements for the future so we tuned everything to an acceptable median. We expect all Vault Hunters to be able to create amazing builds and we want to support that with more ways to grow and reach those power levels.</p><h1>Weapon Hotfixes</h1><p><strong>Maliwan</strong></p><ul><li>Westergun damage increased by 25%</li><li>ASMD damage increased by 28%</li><li>Cutsman damage reduced by 25%</li></ul><p><strong>Tediore</strong></p><ul><li>Ten Gallon damage increased by 8%</li></ul><p><strong>Vladof</strong></p><ul><li>Sickle reload speed increased by 25%</li><li>Faisor damage increased by 15%</li><li>Infiniti damage increased by 40%</li><li>Magnificent damage increased by 25%</li><li>Jericho damage increased by 40%</li><li>Lucian\u2019s Call accuracy and handling reduced</li><li>Lyuda Critical Damage Bonus decreased by 30% and made a modification to address a reported bug that an extra bullet was spawned in the center</li></ul><p><em>The Lyuda\u2019s functionality is to split the projectile from 1 to 3 after a certain distance.

We want Vault Hunters to hunt for unique items across all the worlds. That is the core promise of Mayhem Mode. The targeted adjustments seek to keep the grind fresh while still retaining an increase to unique drops for all parts of the game. We will be closely monitoring the changes to make sure players are still enjoying all the unique gear in the game.</p><p>In between the larger patches that will continue to expand and improve the game\u2014the first one of those coming next week\u2014we're able to make more minor adjustments via these hot fixes or 'micropatches' to improve and fine-tune your experience at a quicker pace. We'll continue to roll out these incremental improvements while evaluating gameplay data and identifying necessary balance adjustments, and will be keeping record of all patches on our site.</p><p>We are hard at work investigating issues that have been reported, including performance concerns and\u00a0potential major bugs. Hot fixes generally are used to make balance changes and are handled by the design team. Additional reported concerns may affect other teams which may require that changes are made in a true content patch/title update. Together the Borderlands 3 teams are working tirelessly to release various patches or updates as soon as possible, however, we didn't want to wait on balance changes just for the sake of appearances.</p><p>We are aware that the above list of changes may not include all concerns that some players have reported experiencing, as detailed in the <a href=\"https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2019-09-18-borderlands-3-troubleshooting-optimization-guide/\">Borderlands 3 Troubleshooting and Optimization Guide</a>.
