Today we will release a hotfix for Borderlands 3, which will be live on all
platforms by 12:00 PM PST. This week’s hotfixes change Rare Spawns in the

Hammerlock](https://borderlands.com/en-US/gunslovetentacles/) campaign add-on
and address a reported concern about world drops in [Mayhem
Mode](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2020-04-21-borderlands-3-mayhem-mode/). To apply hotfixes, wait at the main menu until you see a sign that
says “Hotfixes Applied”! If you are experiencing any issues or want to provide
