Today in [Borderlands 3](https://borderlands.com/en-US/shop/borderlands-3-ultimate-edition), we’re kicking off the last week of
our [Arms Race mini-events](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2021-01-21-arms-race-mini-events/) with **Gear Rush**! This mini-event
is enabled by a hotfix that will be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PT. To
apply hotfixes, wait at the main menu until you see a sign that reads,
“Hotfixes Applied!” If you are experiencing any issues or want to provide
feedback, please submit a ticket to [support.2k.com](https://support.2k.com/).

During the **Gear Rush** mini-event, Rare Chests are more likely to appear in
Arms Race, and the green DAHL chests located at major points of interest in
the Stormblind Complex have an increased chance to contain Arms Race-exclusive
gear. But make sure you don’t spend too long admiring the gear you find,
because the Murdercane will be closing in at a quicker pace. This event will
end on February 11 at 8:59 AM PT / 11:59 AM ET.

The Extra Extra Extraction mini-event in Arms Race will end at 8:59 AM PT with
today’s hotfix.

  * Activates the **Gear Rush** mini-event until February 11 at 8:59 AM PT.
