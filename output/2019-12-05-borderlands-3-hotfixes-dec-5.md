Today we will release a hotfix for [Borderlands 3](https://borderlands.com/en-US/shop/borderlands-3-super-deluxe-edition) which will be live on all
platforms by 3:00 PM PST. This hotfix addresses various issues reported by the
community. Hotfixes are applied at the main menu. You should see a sign in the
background when they have been applied. If you are experiencing any issues or
want to provide feedback, please submit a ticket to
[support.2k.com](https://support.2k.com/).

With this hotfix, the [Bloody Harvest](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2019-10-21-bloody-harvest-trailer-info/) event is fading from
Borderlands 3. As the event ends, you will no longer see Haunted enemies,
travel to Heck, or be able to complete Bloody Harvest challenges until the
spooky season returns next year! Thank you to everyone for the great feedback,
your enjoyment, and the amazing spooky shots taken with Photo Mode in Heck!
We're taking what we've seen and heard from this event and are exploring how
to apply these learnings to the next one.

  * Addressed a reported issue where loot was sometimes falling into an unreachable area in Slaughterstar 3000
  * Addressed a reported issue where the movement speed bonus with Amara's passive ability "Mindfulness" when buffed with Spiritual Driver class mod was sometimes extremely high

 _Mindfulness was designed with the intent that reaching maximum stacks was
not easily achievable so the bonus per grade was high. We want players to take
advantage of move speed but not to the extent where parts of the game may not
function correctly._

  * Addressed a reported issue with the Spiritual Driver class mod where it was sometimes awarding damage for all types of damage and not just gun damage
  * Decreased pet audio so FL4K's Jabber would be less vocal
  * Addressed an issue where Zane's passive ability "Death Follows Close" did not bring the correct bonus to several Kill Skills
  * Addressed a reported issue where Zane's passive ability "Nerves of Steel" would sometimes lose functionality after fast traveling
  * Fixed typos on Desperate Measures and Stainless Steel Bear skills
  * Fixed multiple spots where players were sometimes able to escape the map in Skywell-27
  * Fixed multiple spots where players would sometimes get stuck in Ambermire
  * Fixed various areas in Septic Sluice and Green Diamond Platform that allowed players to reach unintended areas
  * Fixed various areas on Pandora that sometimes allowed players to escape the map
  * Fixed a reported issue where some players could not hear the flaming skulls from Billy, the Anointed
  * Fixed a reported issue where Brick's sledgehammer sometimes continued to spin after being thrown at an enemy during the mission "Hammerlocked"

Hotfixes generally address smaller things, while patches contain code that
must go through a lengthier patch process. The next patch will be coming later
this month and will contain the first DLC, [Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome
Jackpot](https://borderlands.com/en-US/handsomejackpot/)! It will also address
reported concerns that we have seen in the last patch, including Guardian Rank
and additional vending machines in Skywell-27.

Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot will be available to players on December
19 who have purchased the [Season Pass](https://borderlands.com/en-US/shop/borderlands-3-season-pass) or the [Borderlands 3 Super Deluxe
Edition](https://borderlands.com/en-US/shop/borderlands-3-super-deluxe-edition).

At the end of the month, look forward to spending the new year with Maliwan in
Borderlands 3! In a time-limited event, the [Takedown at the Maliwan
Blacksite](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2019-11-22-takedown-at-the-maliwan-blacksite/) will be scaled depending on the number of players in your
party. You'll be able to play solo or with a party of any size to score all
that sweet Takedown loot!
