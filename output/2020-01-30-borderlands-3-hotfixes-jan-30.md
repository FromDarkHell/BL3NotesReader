Today we will release a hotfix for [Borderlands 3](https://borderlands.com/en-US/shop/borderlands-3-super-deluxe-edition), which will be live on
PlayStation®4, Xbox One, and PC by 3:00 PM PST. This hotfix activates the Rare
Chest Riches event, addresses drop rates, and implements permanent scaling for
[Takedown at the Maliwan Blacksite](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2019-11-22-takedown-at-the-maliwan-blacksite/)! To apply hotfixes,
wait at the main menu until you see a sign that says "Hotfixes Applied"! If
these hotfixes are not applied, you will not benefit from the changes! If you
are experiencing any issues or want to provide feedback, please submit a
ticket to [support.2k.com](https://support.2k.com/).

  * Activated the [Rare Chest Riches](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2020-01-30-rare-chest-riches-mini-event/) event, running until February 13
  * Increased the chance to receive Legendary loot from red car trunk chests
  * Addressed a reported issue that the player could sometimes rise into the sky with the cannon during the "One Man's Treasure" mission in [Moxxi's Heist of The Handsome Jackpot](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2019-11-20-moxxi-s-heist-of-the-handsome-jackpot/)

# TRUE TAKEDOWN MODE

We've been looking at the feedback we received during the [Scaling Event for
Takedown at the Maliwan Blacksite](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2019-12-20-takedown-2020-event/) and have decided to make this Scaled
event permanent starting today.

In a February update, we will include a new switch to re-enable what we call
_True Takedown Mode_. True Takedown Mode will restore the Takedown to the
4-player experience that it launched with for extra difficulty. Once
implemented, a lever activating True Takedown Mode will be located on the
right side of the door leading out of the airlock at the beginning of the map.

# RARE SPAWNS AND DROP RATES

Once the [Farming Frenzy](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2020-01-15-borderlands-3-farming-frenzy/) event is over, we are
implementing a permanent change to the Rare Spawns and Drop Rates. After
analyzing play patterns, we are permanently increasing the spawn rate for
these enemies and have buffed their drop rates and their Anointed chance to be
on par with bosses.

# RARE CHEST RICHES EVENT

When the hotfixes roll out today before 3:00 PM PST, a new event will be
activated! During the [Rare Chest Riches](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2020-01-30-rare-chest-riches-mini-event/) Event, which runs until
February 13 at 8:59am PST, all Rare Chests will drop rare loot at an increased
rate, so you're more likely to receive Legendary items any time you open one.
This increased drop rate will also apply when you watch a Twitch streamer open
a Rare Chest, assuming both of you have the [ECHOcast Twitch
Extension](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2019-10-25-borderlands-3-echocast-twitch-extension-guide/) enabled.
Any rewards you score while watching streamers will be waiting for you in your
in-game mailbox the next time you play Borderlands 3. In case you haven't done
so already, click [here](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2019-10-25-borderlands-3-echocast-twitch-extension-guide/) for a step-
by-step guide to linking your SHiFT and Twitch accounts so you can receive
ECHOcast rewards. The Rare Chest Riches event will also apply to the Stadia
version of Borderlands 3.
