Today’s changes to [Borderlands 3](https://borderlands.com/en-US/shop/borderlands-3-ultimate-edition) activate the [True Trials
event](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2021-05-12-borderlands-3-true-trials-mini-events/) for the Trial of Cunning. During this event, the Trial of
Cunning boss has received a HUGE boost to its health and the damage it will be
dishing out to players. This mini-event cannot be turned off, so new players
beware!

[Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2021-04-01-borderlands-3-crazy-earl-reroll-maurice-black-market-vending-machine/) will be moving to a new location on Thursdays at 9:00 AM PT
/ 12:00 PM ET and is activated with a hotfix. This week’s gear has a special
appearance of a piece of gear from the second Borderlands 3 add-on. As a
reminder, players are unable to equip DLC gear if they do not own the DLC it
comes from.

These changes will be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PT. To apply hotfixes,
wait at the main menu until you see a sign that reads, “Hotfixes Applied!” If
you are experiencing any issues or want to provide feedback, please submit a
ticket to [support.2k.com](https://support.2k.com/).

  * Activating the True Trial of Cunning event, which will be active until May 27 at 8:59 AM PT

As a reward, the boss will be dropping two Legendary weapons. Each drop has a
chance of being either Sickle or Skullmasher from [Gun, Love, and
Tentacles](https://borderlands.com/en-US/gunslovetentacles/) add-on ( _Note:
Players who do not own the Guns, Love, and Tentacles add-on will not be able
to equip Skullmasher until they own the respective add-on_ ).

In addition, the chest at the end of the Trial of Cunning will be full of
Legendaries regardless of how quickly you completed it or how many objectives
you scored!

With this hotfix, the Trial of Survival will be returning to its regular
state.
