Today in [Borderlands 3](https://borderlands.com/en-US/shop/borderlands-3-super-deluxe-edition), we addressed a reported exploit
and comment on the frequency of future changes to the game. These changes will
be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PST. To apply hotfixes, wait at the main
menu until you see a sign that says, “Hotfixes Applied!” If you are
experiencing any issues or want to provide feedback, please submit a ticket to
[support.2k.com](https://support.2k.com/).

  * Prevented enemies from indefinitely spawning during [Takedown at the Guardian Breach](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2020-06-11-takedown-at-the-guardian-breach/)
  * Addressed a reported concern that new hotfixes were being added to Borderlands 3 too frequently

After this week, we will be changing the cadence in which we put out new
hotfixes. Moving forward, the hotfix schedule will mirror when we put out
updates, with exceptions for any emergency adjustments that we feel are
necessary to the integrity of the game. The team is working hard on future
updates and new content, which we are excited to share with you soon™.
