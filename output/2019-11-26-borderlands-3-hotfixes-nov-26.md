Today we will release a hotfix for [Borderlands 3](https://borderlands.com/en-US/shop/borderlands-3-super-deluxe-edition), which will be live on all
platforms by 3:00 PM PST, that addresses reported concerns some users were
having with The Butcher after last week's update. Additionally, we're aware
that some players reported experiencing other issues after installing the
[November 21 Patch and Hotfixes](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2019-11-21-borderlands-3-patch-hotfixes-nov-21/) and we're working to
address those in future updates.

  * Addressed a reported concern where The Butcher could occasionally experience excessive recoil
