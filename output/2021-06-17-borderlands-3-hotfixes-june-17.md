Today’s changes to [Borderlands 3](https://borderlands.com/en-US/shop/borderlands-3-ultimate-edition) activate the [True Trials
event](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2021-05-12-borderlands-3-true-trials-mini-events/) for the Trial of Supremacy. During this event, the Trial
of Supremacy boss has received a HUGE boost to its health and the damage it
will be dishing out to players. This mini-event cannot be turned off, so new
players beware!

[Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2021-04-01-borderlands-3-crazy-earl-reroll-maurice-black-market-vending-machine/) will be moving to a new location on Thursdays at 9:00 AM PT
/ 12:00 PM ET and is activated with a hotfix. This week’s gear has a special
appearance of a piece of gear from the sixth Borderlands 3 add-on. As a
reminder, players are unable to equip DLC gear if they do not own the DLC it
comes from.

These changes will be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PT. To apply hotfixes,
wait at the main menu until you see a sign that reads, “Hotfixes Applied!” If
you are experiencing any issues or want to provide feedback, please submit a
ticket to [support.2k.com](https://support.2k.com/).

  * Activating the True Trial of Supremacy event, which will be active until June 24 at 8:59 AM PT

As a reward, the boss will be dropping two Legendary weapons. Each drop has a
chance of being either The Monarch or Atlas Replay from the [Director's
Cut](https://borderlands.com/en-US/seasonpass2/) add-on ( _Note: Players who
do not own the Director's Cut add-on will not be able to equip Atlas Replay
until they own the respective add-on_ ).

In addition, the chest at the end of the Trial of Supremacy will be full of
Legendaries regardless of how quickly you completed it or how many objectives
you scored!

With this hotfix, the Trial of Instinct will be returning to its regular
state.
