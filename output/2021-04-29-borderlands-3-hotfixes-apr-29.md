Today’s changes to [Borderlands 3](https://borderlands.com/en-US/shop/borderlands-3-ultimate-edition) buff various pieces of end-game gear
and address reported instances of the wrong Class Mod sometimes dropping for
the Beastmaster and the Gunner in the [Guns, Love, and
Tentacles](https://borderlands.com/en-US/gunslovetentacles/) add-on.

As a reminder, [Maurice’s Black Market Vending
Machine](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2021-04-01-borderlands-3-crazy-earl-reroll-maurice-black-market-vending-machine/) will be moving to a new
location on Thursdays at 9:00 AM PT / 12:00 PM ET and is activated with a
hotfix.

These changes will be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PT. To apply hotfixes,
wait at the main menu until you see a sign that reads, “Hotfixes Applied!” If
you are experiencing any issues or want to provide feedback, please submit a
ticket to [support.2k.com](https://support.2k.com/).

  * Made a change that makes the Class Mods for the Beastmaster and the Gunner drop for their respective characters more frequently in the Guns, Love, and Tentacles Add-on

# Weapon Adjustments

We’re taking a pass on some gear obtained in higher Mayhem levels and the two
Takedowns. Our goal is to provide a stairstep experience from Mayhem 4, to
[Takedown at the Maliwan Blacksite](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2019-11-22-takedown-at-the-maliwan-blacksite/), to Mayhem 6, to
[Takedown at the Guardian Breach](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2020-06-11-takedown-at-the-guardian-breach/). Players should feel a
ramp of power through these changes as they tackle each piece of content. The
following pieces of gear received a damage buff:
